Welcome! This repo is the Disability Trends final project for Prof. Yudong Liu's Spring 2024 CSCI 404 (NLP) class!

## Running the project
There are a few steps involved in running the project:

1. Installing dependencies
2. Hotfixing Gensim
3. Downloading/acquiring data
4. Execution

### Installing Dependencies

- `/code/requirements-gen.txt` for general data handling/processing libraries
- `/code/requirements-ml.txt` for libraries related to machine learning such as TensorFlow
