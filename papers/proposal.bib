abstract={Greyhound's share would be about $12 million and Roger Pike] said the company would have to increase individual bus fares by 10 to 15 per cent to cover it. That could be disastrous for an industry already faced with steadily declining ridership, he said. She disputed figures provided by Pike that Greyhound's potential market share would be negligible because there are only 53,000 people from Ontario to B.C. who have trouble using existing coaches and could use a special bus if one was available. Steve Bacovsky, who operates National Motor Coach Systems Ltd., a charter bus service with one fully accessible coach, said he believes the disabled community is a growing market for bus companies.},
