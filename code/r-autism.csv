In an effort to declutter the sub and reduce rule-breaking posts, this will serve as the master thread for ABA discussion.
  
    This is the place for asking questions, sharing personal experiences, linking to blog posts or scientific articles, and posting opinions. If you’re a parent seeking alternatives to ABA, please give us a little information about your child. Their age and what goals you have for them are usually enough.

What is ABA? From Medical News Today:
  

    ABA therapy attempts to modify and encourage certain behaviors, particularly in autistic children. It is not a cure for ASD, but it can help individuals improve and develop an array of skills.
  


    This form of therapy is rooted in behaviorist theories. This assumes that reinforcement can increase or decrease the chance of a behavior happening when a similar set of circumstances occurs again in the future.
  

    From our wiki: How can I tell whether a treatment is reputable? Are there warning signs of a bad or harmful therapy?

3,Whoo else is terrified about the UK government's disability attack? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cj7fgv/whoo_else_is_terrified_about_the_uk_governments/,127,60,2024-05-03 12:27:13.117000+00:00,"I'm from the UK and as most people will be aware our government are trying to mandate and force disabled people into work.
  
    I'm absolutely terrified amongst lots of other people. I'm autistic with anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, vasovagal syndrome, POTS, neuralgia and fibromyalgia. I have tried working in the past and it didn't end well because I was passing out on the job working way above the hours I could manage.
  
    I'm absolutely terrified that my monthly payments are going to be taken away and I'm going to be forced into a job place that's going to cause my illnesses to get worse along with my mental health.
  
    Is anyone else terrified? I don't even know who to vote for next election because it seems both conservative and labour are opting to rip away the integrity of people with disabilities. I genuinely think people with autism will be hit the hardest since people with autism have comobidity with anxiety/depression. Working a stressful job and being told what to do is the absolute worst especially for people with the PDA (pathological demand avoidance) profile of autism which I suffer with. I can't handle the thought of being trapped in a job, being somewhere from this time to that time. It's entrapment. It's not comfortable.
  
    The government seem to think work is healthy and good for people but if you're autistic it isn't healthy, it can add excessive stress and worry.

6,Sister being weird about my having an autistic partner.,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cj0wrp/sister_being_weird_about_my_having_an_autistic/,43,11,2024-05-03 05:25:05.517000+00:00,"So. I'm autistic. And so is my partner.My partner was diagnosed in childhood and I was diagnosed just two years ago as an adult.
  
    And I love my partner. He's great.We've been together a little over 5 months and he's about to meet the family when they come home for a little mini reunion type thing.
  
    And him being autistic has never been a problem because our breeds of autism just mesh pretty well.He doesn't know how to read subtle body language and tone. I over-enunciate my tone in conversation and over-communicate with body language.I get super anxious because I don't pick up on even some obvious verbal cues and eye contact makes me uneasy. He's completely monotone unless he's upset or extremely happy and is very, very blunt and direct, and doesn't make eye contact.I'd say good communication is the pillar of support for a good relationship and our needs and styles just happen to fit.
  
    It's been going great. I love him. I hope we're together for a while.
  
    ...My sister married an autistic man.An autistic man who self identifies as not having Autism but instead Aspergers syndrome, and despite being told that aspergers is now outdated and is lumped into the greater category of Autism Spectrum Disorder, is not willing to change the name of his diagnosis at least socially speaking.
  
    It makes me uneasy. I dont like the way he's so adament about it. It gives me subtle but clear aspie surpremacy vibes, but that's for another day.
  
    Ever since my sister found out I was dating a guy who's autistic, she's been acting like she's some authority figure on having an autistic partner.""You're just going to have to deal with the meltdowns and the breakdowns.""""You might have to leave the room and just let him get through those things alone""""Don't get offended if he doesn't talk to you for a few days he probably just forgot""
  
    She's given me a lot of unsolicited advice on handling my autistic partner when he melts down, shuts down, or breaks down. Which...Why the hell is she giving me advice on that.
  
    She's not autistic. She's never met my partner. She's only seen me in person since I was diagnosed a very small number of times and is not familiar with me fully unmasked. And she's frequently giving me advice on how to handle my partner's meltdowns, which I've never mentioned to her before.
  
    My partner has never had a meltdown or shutdown with me.Maybe a little bit of a breakdown recently. He cried and I held his hand and I listened to what was troubling him and he vented to me, frustrated, for well over an hour, before it came to a natural low and we relaxed and cuddled the night away.But he's never had a meltdown or a shutdown with me in the 5 months we've been together or as friends before then.
  
    And granted, I'm sure she's making an attempt to bond with me over this common factor. We both have autistic partners and of course, there are shared experiences related to that. Listening to infodumping, embracing certain quirks about our partners that they might not have if they were neurotypical.
  
    But in her attempt to bond I'm really feeling that she's projecting her relationship with her husband onto me.She's always giving me advice on how to deal with meltdowns and shutdowns and breakdowns when I've never communicated my partner having those problems to her.She also doesn't know my partner's background.Her partner has a traumatic background and I have no doubt that his traumatizing experiences (of the ones I've heard about, no child deserves to go through what he's been through) make his breakdowns/meltdowns/shutdowns more dramatic and maybe harder to handle. But surely she must know that's not the standard for every autistic person, right?
  
    I dunno. It rubs me the wrong way and I'm kind of not sure how to address it because I know it doesnt come from a place of malice. It just kind of hurts that she comes off as trying to act like an authority figure on having an autistic partner when she knows (but never acknowledges) that I'm autistic and knows nothing beyond very basic surface level information about my partner, let alone his experience as an autistic man.

I’ve tried using a soda stream but I don’t like the water that comes out of there. I haven’t tried flavoring is that worth it or is there another solution? I also have a hard time telling when I’m thirsty and remembering to drink.

I just can’t do it anymore. It’s exhausting and no one listens to me anyways. My family are horrible, they don’t listen to me and it often feels like they don’t care about me. They’ve basically thrown me to the side in favor of an abusive narcissist because he has money. They only use me for what I can do for them I don’t think they genuinely love and care about me- only see me as a source of free labor.
  
    Because of that and recent events I’ve decided to stop talking all together. It hurts way less. I know they’re going to make fun of me and get mad at me for not talking to them but I don’t care. When are they ever not angry at me? I’ll only talk to my cat and sing to myself since she doesn’t know what’s going on and it’s what’s comforting to me. I don’t know the correct terminology though. I have had moments in the past where I’ve been selectively mute and I can’t tell if I’m this exact instance it’d be elective mutism or selective mutism.
  
    Anyways, I’d like some advice. I downloaded an app to help me communicate without talking but it’s only a one month trial, are there any good free apps that I could use?

    The hopelessly cruel and bitter people will immediately weaponize it against you, others will see it as an opportunity to peacock their perceived superiority by acting incredibly patronizing and infantilizing, and the ones who truly care about you will not act any differently because they're already cool with you being yourself.

    But I personally love showers so much! It feels like the only time where my body is all the same temperature when in the shower. I also love feeling clean and hate when I feel sweaty, dirty, or greasy at all so I really look forward to when I get to shower. For me it’s also a really good place to “reset” after I’ve had a rough day because I don’t have to talk to anyone, can play some of my favorite videos in the background and overall decompress after being overwhelmed all day. But mainly I hate feeling dirty it’s my biggest sensory issues so that mainly why I like them so much!

It's after I have been around people I find social interactions exhausting, but after I have been around people my mind goes into overdrive and I can't shut it up. I also can't focus, can't sleep, can't stay calm my mind goes over everything again and again, as I get older this discomfort is now just like mental screaming when I get home from social interactions. 20 years ago I could manage online interactions just fine now they are part of the problem. I used to be a big supported of social media, now it feels like a path to mental pain.
  
    When I had my first proper job years ago I was single and afterwards, I would just sit in a dark room listening to music till the worst of it ended. I have only ever done jobs for a short time because I always end up massively burnt out. The last job I made the mistake of working in a school and I couldn't quit due to needing to earn a living, I quit in 2020 as the workload meant not only would I continue to do my own job, and my bosses' job but I also had to somehow clean down three workspaces between classes.
  
    My other half has been promoted a fair few times so now I am self-employed but I find it really hard because that mental screaming does build up. Working in and of itself makes me calm and helps me stay focused but it does mean dealing with people and finding clients and it quickly gets overwhelming sending out cold emails, better than cold calls which are impossible.
  
    My ex-therapist said it was a fear of being judged, see the thing is I don't actually care what people think of me, I am very much aware most people don't observe me when I am out and about. Most people don't even think twice if I interact with them, people are far too busy in their own lives. Hell, I have old University professors who don't remember me at all, I am very forgettable.
  
    Sometimes I feel lonely but as soon as I spend time around people I realise it wasn't loneliness but boredom, of feeling like I am doing the same thing on repeat.
  
    Does anyone else feel this way, how do you find balance?
  
    How do you stop the mental screaming? Or at least negate it without days and days of music.

So I wanted to explain what it means because I was just doing some reading and the term was used and I understood immediately.
  
    So I used to think ""black and white"" meant I only see two solutions to problems. Like ""How do I get to the grocery store."" Well you can go straight, then left, then right and then turn left again. Or you can turn left then straight, then right, then left, or you can... Those are some example answers Soni thought ""oh I don't have that. I listed so many options."" I thought a black and white answer would be ""well you have to go straight, left, right, then left. You can't go any other way and I'm not open to other options.""
  
    What black and white thinking is really about is ""all or nothing"". If I clean my room, if I know I'm not going to be able to properly wipe the floor because my desk is in the way, there's no point in cleaning anything because I'm still going to feel like it's dirty when I'm done. If I do the dishes and know that I won't have time to wash the silverware, there's no point in starting because the dishes will still be dirty. It'll feel like useless work. This is black and white thinking. ""I have to do X perfectly or there's no point in doing it."" Because of this, I never really cleaned growing up. I mean my parents would force me, but I would always feel like ""what's the point of cleaning my room if I know there are other parts of the house that are dirty?"" And I didn't have the time/energy/motivation to clean the rest of the house, so I just didn't clean my room.
  
    Maybe I still have this wrong, so let me know if you have a different way to think of it.

You're pretty, you're popular, you're talented, you're athletic, you're good at everything. There's this one literally this ONE good thing about me and I'm not allowed to be proud of that. It sucks. I mean, I'm fat, I'm ugly, I'm mentally ill, disabled, a gay t r a n n y, i don't have one singular friend. Thinking is the only thing I'm good at and no one lets me have it. I hate who I am.

25,Are you more rigid about your routine or environment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cjae4i/are_you_more_rigid_about_your_routine_or/,2,3,2024-05-03 14:42:41.825000+00:00,"I always read about how autists are rigid about their routine and repetitions of things through time,  but I'm curious about how do you feel about your personal space and environment.
  
    I don't like when others change my daily activities or my schedule without consulting me, but I guess that's common for most people,  even allistics. I'm pretty fine with changing my own schedule.
  
    But my most violent meltdowns were related to people changing or invading my environment. Like one time my neighbor invaded my backyard, or when once my ex-MIL came into my house and rearranged my furniture, those episodes lead me to my worse meltdowns: breaking things, screaming, running away and hiding.
  
    Does anyone else don't have routine rigidity,  but it's very particular about their own space? I don't see this need of controlling space being discussed as often as controlling time or activities.
  
    Edit: English isn't my native language,  maybe trespassing is a better word for invading, I'm not sure. By invading, I mean he used my property to place his own things without my consent. Which of course no one would like, but a NT would react differently.

It was sudden and thankfully it was almost instant for her.
  
    I wasn't in the crash with her. But I was at the scene after it happened, and it broke me. She was my support and safe place. The one who knew me better than I know myself and the one who helped me understand myself in ways I never knew existed.
  
    For the first few days after I was helpless, I couldn't eat or drink. Sleep was almost non existent and I broke down constantly.
  
    Grief is a strange thing and everyone goes through it differently. I was with her for nearly 8 years. We got together at 15 and everyone has said our relationship is the stuff you see in books. We were perfect for each other.
  
    Every professional I've seen (and I've seen a lot) have all said that the way I've coped with this was amazing and that most people in my situation would be in a lot worse of a situation than I am.
  
    But I know that I haven't dealt with this properly at all. My autism has stopped my greaving properly. After a month I felt like how I was before she died. I was back to work, I was sleeping relatively decently, I stopped having random breakdowns.
  
    It feels like I've stopped greaving and I hate it. I look at pictures and videos and I feel sad but I don't cry. I have so many memories with her and I don't feel sad or happy about them. They feel like events that have had no effect on my life dispite knowing that they made me happy before.

I’ve been trying to learn from my therapist the things that I find mysterious (how she walks, talks, dresses, interacts with other people, etc.). Having not made much progress, it’s been this huge source of frustration and confusion for me. Come to find out, I’m autistic, and I will never “be a person” in the way that I’ve been wanting.

Humor is extremely subjective. Who are some of your favorite comedians and why do you love them? Don't worry about giving clichéd or embarrassing answers.
  
    I'll go first. Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Louis CK, Groucho Marx.
  
    These guys have a mastery of language unlike the rest of us mere mortals. They clearly love words and wordplay. They're all extremely honest about their opinions. Pryor and CK are totally open about their flaws in their acts and it makes them endearing. Pryor seems like a naturally cool guy, CK seems like a giant pudgy middle aged dork but they both are open about their personal foibles. Groucho and Carlin are honest in a different way, they're the guys who like to point out everyone else's personal foibles with razor sharp wit. I never get the feeling like I know them as a friend but I always like them anyway. They clearly have fun playing with words. Obviously all these guys have amazing timing.
  
    Also, I still like Adam Sandler. He's got a lot of shitty movies but every so often he releases something that reminds me why he's lasted as an A lister. He's silly, I like silly, he's not trying to be smart, he's just trying to be funny.

    I don't know if you've ever had this feeling and I'm not sure how to describe it but sometimes when I have a lot of things to do I have a sort of ""analysis paralysis"" (or ""choice paralysis""), I feel overwhelmed by all these and I feel stuck on where to really start, what to do? etc... And most of the time it is said that the beginning is often difficult but when you take action regardless of the choice, things are supposed to be easier and the paralysis ""disappears"". Except... I feel like even when I take action, things don't come naturally and I always feel stuck. It's as if nothing is going well with the flow and you have this feeling that you're struggling for nothing and wasting your time.
  
    An example to compare the feeling would be maybe art block ? : you want to draw but a kind of struggle overwhelms you and you cannot bring out what you want no matter how hard you try.

Pulling my face and neck muscles into unnatural positions. Organic laughing and smiling irritates my condition as well, but the masking face feels .. different. More painful. More tense.

(psychiatrictimes.com)

    I found this article interesting. I hope this meets sub rules.
  
    tl;dr Neurodiversity is defined by it's deficits. AHDH Autism defined by attention and social deficits, at least by this society. If a person seeks help for a problem, the patient deserves treatment. They are not the problem, Everyone gets sick. Chronic illness exists in all shapes. We should have compassion and accommodation for each other with understanding of our abilities and limitations. Illness does not need imply stigma.
  
    I've noticed the community can get divisive on some of this stuff, so I'm not trying to stir the pot. I think it's worthy of an interesting thread of responses.
  
    My opinion is that this can be a picky and personal topic so it's easy to have a gut reaction to medicalizing Autism, but as a spectrum which presents difference in wavelength and amplitude, amplitude is the degree the trait manifests as a suffering illness in need of support - not a superpower. And there is no shame in needing help, it's getting the help we need that's hard because people don't understand neurological issues until they're explained, like Alzheimer's and Epilepsy. People think we grow out of it for sun's sake.
  
    I understand there's a history and a culture here which forms an identity and I'm new here. I have no problem understanding spikey development as an issue, I also have Bipolar I. I talk to a doctor because I have problems, of course it's an Illness. And a personality, much more than an illness, it's a language.

    Hello everyone,
  
    I went through a pretty tough time last year due to the pressure of my master's degree and the responsibilities that came with it. Eventually, it became too much, and I ended up in psychiatric emergency care. After heavily medicating, I'm finally feeling much better six months later and I'm slowly tapering off the medication. Strangely, since then, I've been feeling incredibly creative. It's as if a door inside me has opened, unleashing a flood of emotions and thoughts that I never knew I had. So, I've decided to channel all of that into art. I've been using AI to create images, songs, and music videos. Additionally, I've taken up painting pots for my extensive collection of plants—something I never thought I'd be capable of after being told I was untalented and unskilled when I was younger.
  
    Remember to stay true to yourself and don't let anything or anyone limit you. By the way, despite everything, I managed to pass my master's in medicinal science. I had to take my exams at the lowest point of my treatment, so I want to encourage you all never to give up. Keep shining and keep rocking!

I have recently been diagnosed as autistic. I always suspected this was the case, but I am now on a path to better understand myself. Part of this is learning about terms like masking, shutting down, etc. These are behaviors I know I do, and it’s great to have awareness and names to these things, but the concept of masking in particular has sewn a little doubt for me with regards to my authentic self.
  
    So, obviously I am aware I mask. It’s a defense mechanism for me. But now that I am more aware of it, I’ve noticed distress at this notion that I basically behave as someone I’m not around certain people. Most people, really. This has led me to feel…almost dishonest about who I am towards people, and that doesn’t feel good, but I know I do it to protect myself from people who don’t know how to interact with autistic people or may find me off putting.
  
    But mostly, these realizations have made me question who I am. I understand my behaviors while masking are very deliberate (forcing eye contact, forcing tones of voice, forcing expressions,) but what I’m getting at here is that my decision TO mask has been so automatic for so long, the lines have become blurred. Where does masking end and the authentic me begin? It really has made me question who I am - which I think is a good thing, but…I need some help with this. I sometimes wonder if I’m being authentic with my closest friends and loved ones. I just want people to see me as I am, and I feel like I don’t know who that is.
  
    Have any of you struggled with this before, and if so, what was helpful to you? Thank you so much in advance for any insight you might have. I’m glad to have found this place.

The reason I don't try to defend myself and usually just shut down in discussions with my partners comes from (this is gonna be a shock) childhood trauma! Has anyone else had the experience where a parent was mad at them and when you tried to explain the what/why to defend yourself, your autistic tone and facial expression made it so you just look like a ""bad liar"" and they treated you worse? I learned over the years to keep my mouth shut, not offer any defense, and accept whatever treatment I got because I anything I said would just make it worse for me. I spent years in relationships where my partner would get upset and I contributed NOTHING to the discussion. I wanted to but I thought I'd only make things worse. My ability to communicate was destroyed and I had no idea how to share my feelings without fear of ridicule.
  
    If anyone else reads this and can relate, I hope it gives you the clarity that it gave me. It feels like a wound that's been open for 38 years is finally starting to heal.

I am a 22 year male old previously diagnosed with Aspergers around 7 years old, however, my parents lost my autism diagnosis and I will have to redo it at some point in the future. I graduated in Graphic Design years ago but I am pursuing a career as a DJ and music producer, as I have always loved electronic music and have always been passionate about House & Techno, but because of my autism I have a certain difficulty in making friends, meeting new people and some communication problems.
  
    Being a DJ is basically the opposite of Aspergers: the DJ is an extroverted guy, who goes to lots of parties, who brings his art and music to his audience and who is always charismatic, the problem being that because of my poor communication skills, I feel very anxious in places with lots of unfamiliar people, mainly for fear of being judged or people not understanding what I say, leading to people making fun of me which could ruin my career.
  
    I took a DJ course a few months ago and I completed it at the beginning of this year, but I still haven't gotten a big gig at a party or club, because I've simply never been to a club or a party, and since I literally don't have any friends (yes, 0 friends, 0 girlfriends, and I don't mind girlfriends since I don't want a romantic relationship), it's extremely difficult for me to go alone to a place I've never been to before, like a lot of strange people who could ended up misunderstood me.
  
    The big problem with all of this is that I REALLY need to go to these places, since clubs and raves are part of the DJ job, and how will I be famous and known if I'm still a bedroom DJ? I need to go to clubs to be able to network, meet new people, know the club managers, but I feel that this is very exhausting because as I am autistic and extremely anxious, places like this usually make me feel somewhat uncomfortable but not because of the lighting or the loud sound, but rather because of the crowd of unknown people, of people you don't know could be planning to do to you if you take a wrong step.

    I'm in the process of applying to jobs and I go back and forth all the time on whether or not to actually select ""yes, I have a disability"" if it's part of the application.
  
    I'm 27F with autism, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. They affect me in different amounts and ways, but I would say, based on the general way society forces people to function, I have a disability. I would rather be awake 2pm - 5am, just want to live alone with a 100 different animals of all types, and don't understand most of what being an adult requires. Thankful as FUCK for my parents who are endlessly supportive and letting me figure things out at my own pace. Anyways.... Lol
  
    I have figured out how to be functional and I mask hella well, so once I'm in, I'm in. My current part time job promoted me a week after I started and she tells me all the time how I'm her least problematic and, thus, favourite manager 💀 so really, it doesn't seem like a disability, at least in that it rarely affects my work (don't get me started on my masters thesis... Not having deadlines doesn't work for me), but it affects my life outside of it.
  
    My other, main question is whether selectimg disability affects the process at all, negative or positive. Especially if it could hurt the chances, then I'm more than happy selecting no. Most the jobs I'm applying for involved physical labour, so I don't want them assuming a physical disability either and then discounting me for that.
  
    I don't know y'all... Life is too much lol
  
    Thanks though if you comment 💕

Perhaps I should have communicated I didn’t want to stay there, but too late now. I become visibly anxious and state “I’ll just eat in the car” and my mom says “No you’re not it’s locked” so I move myself to the tables outside the restaurant.  I sip my coffee and try to regulate myself until my mom comes out and the guys at the table in front of me are like “We say (my name)” and she was like “yeah. she doesn’t want to eat with us” ….felt that right in the heart. I tried to talk to her about what happened and how I felt like she was making me feel bad for my autistic traits. She acknowledged it atleast, but was like “Ok, just move on!” But as you can see I am very much not moved on. I’ve been crying from the cafe back.

My sister (17) is NT and completely mentally and physically healthy. We’ve never really gotten along, but we tolerate each other when we have to.

She’s become a majorly sassy bitch in the past few years, she’s always been dismissive of my autism but it’s gotten to a point where she straight up TRIES to agrivate me.
  
    I tell her I don’t want to talk right now, she follows me and keeps talking until I literally have to force her out of my room. I have a naturally ‘bored’ tone so whenever I say something that can be perceived as negative she responds with ‘someone’s in a mood’ or ‘someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed’ KNOWING it annoys me. She mocks my eating habits because I have a limited food pallet. She complains about how I ‘do nothing all day’ when I absolutely do, I just get my chores done before she even wakes up because I’m routine oriented.
  
    Basically she thinks I’m ‘weird’ and ‘not cool enough’ and harasses me for it. She knows I’m autistic, she knows a bunch of other family members are. She just likes to piss me off and act better than me because she’s ‘normal’. I’m so sick of her shit and I have no idea how to stop her, I’ve tried everything.

    She has always been a person who can't hold back her anger and every time we see each other she manages to make me feel uncomfortable and wrong.
  
    Now, I would like to open up to her by telling her about my discovery and hoping for a possible change/greater understanding of my life.
  
    How can I do?

84,My autistic best friend is really hurting me and I don’t know what to do,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cj3zdm/my_autistic_best_friend_is_really_hurting_me_and/,1,2,2024-05-03 08:58:17.539000+00:00,"I (f18) have not been diagnosed, and my best friend (f18) stims, has very intense special interest, she’s VERY analytical and blunt, and has a more reactive temperament than other NT. I’m just describing some common symptoms so you have an idea of what’s going on.
  


    she doesn’t care about my interests
  


    I find it so hard to be her friend sometimes because of her very specific and strong interests, that I feel like whenever I try to share something I’m interested in, she disregards it or doesn’t comment. I’m feel like i try so hard to engage with what she likes even if it’s not usually something I would be into at all, and I don’t know why I even expect reciprocity anymore (should I expect reciprocity??), because it’s always a one sided effort.
  
    2) She’s mean
  
    I don’t think she means to be, but she’s so brash and blunt that it sounds like she’s talking down to me, or just straight up calling how I act or feel wrong. I tried to apologize for saying a snarky comment by saying “oh that was bitchy my bad” and she said “it wasn’t but okay” in a tone that made it sound like it wasn’t a forgiveness—but a dig on how I was wrong to do that as if I made a social faux pas. She also tries to argue with me when it comes to the way I FEEL about the world around me. for example, I said “omg I’m scared to get married wedding photos stress me out I’m so insecure about a dress haha!” and she said “there are wedding dresses that would hide your insecurity” — I understand this; she saw a problem rather than a feeling and tried to fix it for me — I responded, “yea I just don’t feel good in anything lol” and she said “clearly you haven’t deep dived like I have”  — it just hurt me even though I understand why she would go that direction. There are so many other examples of feeling shut down completely by her, and I don’t know what to do
  
    3) weirdly attention seeking ?
  
    It always seems like she moans and groans randomly to try and get a reaction out of me. Making off-kilter remarks can be funny, but it's always in the middle of my sentence or out of nowhere, and I feel like atp it's to get a laugh or a reaction out of me to shine the spotlight on herself. I don't know how to react to them, and I can't tell if she's just verbalizing her stream of consciousness/stimming or trying to get attention, because I can always feel her eyes trying to gauge my reaction too. Is this an oversight on my part? I am people pleasing (i know bad habit) so I always laugh or riff with her even when I'm in the middle of a thought because I understand having a thought and wanting someone to care about it even if it's small. It drives me a little nuts though because I can’t ask if she wants my attention, I don’t want to belittle her. It feels like mind games I didn’t sign up for and it confuses me and drives me nuts.
  
    Finally
  
    I don’t need someone to tell me she means well, I just need help on how to cope. I’m such a sensitive person, and i could well up from the amount of times she has just been condescending and uncaring about the things I say or think when i seem to care so much about how she sees the world. I am lost. I want to cry around her sometimes but I feel crazy and overly sensitive for being that way. The times when I have tried to communicate hurt, She very quickly jumps in with an explanation as to why she says whatever she says or does whatever she does, but It feels like her intentions don’t negate her actions or the effect it had on me. it feels like All I ask for is basic decency and I just don’t get it.
  
    I’m sorry this is so long, but she’s at my house for ten days, and it’s been two and I feel like i’m gonna explode with how sad and confused I am. this is a lifelong friendship btw (since 4-5yrs old) Someone please help.

That opened a train of thought I didn't want to have, but that has been there for a little while ... Do I have less love to give? I've noticed that people around me love me more than I thought was normal. And I don't think I love them as much. It sounds really harsh, which is why I have a throwaway. I love them as much as I can possibly love them, but they still seem to love me more and so much easier. And I've recently entered a relationship. I love them more than I've loved before, but what if it's not enough? I already feel like I'm not enough as a friend or sibling, or even as a son. How can I be enough for them?
  
    I don't want reassurance that I can love just as much, I just want to know if someone else has that experience. I want to know if I can be enough. Because right now I'm scared. What if I can love just as much, but I don't. What if I just don't love anyone that much. If it's neurological, then I know I'm loving them as much as I can. But if not... Then I'm the problem.

88,Where does the 'Autism does not impair empathy' factoid come from? Whats your opinion?,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cj7dq3/where_does_the_autism_does_not_impair_empathy/,0,14,2024-05-03 12:24:48.465000+00:00,"Hey Reddit :)
  
    I've been lurking a lot on the Autism-adjacent subreddits (this one, AskAutism, EvilAutism...) and I often hear neurotypical people asking about impaired empathy in autism.
  
    The general opinion on Reddit seems to be that 'Autistic people have less empathy' is an outdated misconception, and newer studies prove that autistic people have the same amount, or sometimes even more empathy. Or if empathy is impaired, its only 'cognitive' empathy, and 'affective' empathy is the same.
  
    Now my question is - where does this claim come from? Are there any sources to back it up? Is it your lived experience that you experience the same amount or even more empathy than neurotypical people?
  
    I have read through a lot of studies (Disclaimer: I am of course not a psychologist nor a researcher in this field) and found them to differ on what specific empathy traits are impacted (and of course, the definition of empathy itself is a hotly debated topic), but they all seem to agree that empathy is definitely impacted in some way. This is anecdotally also the lived experience of my very close friends and loved ones with autism. They actually struggle sometimes with online autistic spaces claiming that their lack of empathy does not stem from autism, as it makes them feel left out and not understood.
  
    For example, I found this metastudy (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01902/full) which seems to conclude that there is a significant correlation between having autism and having some forms of empathy impaired.
  
    There is also this study (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00) which has a pretty low sample size but seems to be highly cited, which again finds an impaired EQ in autistic individuals.
  
    Where do you think the general reddit opinion comes from? Is it backlash due to the fear of being misunderstood or judged? Am I unaware of some newer findings (please do point me in the direction).
  
    Oh, and disclaimer - I know that a trend is not the same as 'every autistic person has impaired empathy' and that you cannot generalise like this. I am simply commenting on the seeming lack of discourse on the lack of empathy and how that can also be a source of distress for autistic people.

    This is just a personnal opinion TW: Dark thoughts/ Rant/ Feelings
  
    I think that we could prevent a lot of non diagnosed adults to unfortunately decide to end their life if doctors were more prone to take undiagnosed autism seriously.
  
    Trying to get a diagnosis as an adult is like battling in a tournament and losing at each round.
  
    My mother had 8 children.
  
    Of course she never “saw the signs”. Because she had 8 children.
  
    I also believe a lot of parents were unaware of autism back in the 1990’s or early 2000.
  
    “Why is it important to diagnose you with this, there is no cure”
  
    Well knowing who you are is a cure in itself I believe.
  
    I’ve been always wondering why I feel left out, why I don’t understand people’s action.
  
    I’ve been having trouble making real friendships.
  
    I struggled in my relationships.
  
    I also suffered from depression and had dark thoughts as early as when I was in middle school.
  
    I think it’s important to get the diagnosis to know who you are.
  
    I don’t know who I am.
  
    I’ve been dissociating a lot. A lot of days I just feel like I don’t feel anything. Like I’m an empty shell.
  
    It’s not that I don’t feel anything, I do have empathy. Sometimes I cry easily, sometimes I’m hard as a rock and feel so dissociated that I don’t.

Context is that we are long distance ""friends"" who hardly interact anymore, but my little sister often calls Kylie's little sister, and Kylie makes an appearance every so often. The reason ""friend"" is in quotes is because I started to distance myself after she began treating me unfavorably. (to little avail, because me and Kylie's parents are friends so I am expected to be 'besties' with her. ugh)
  
    Anyway, my special interest is on Bluey, yes, the kids show. At least, for those who are mostly unaware of the media, it is for kids. I would argue that it is just as valuable for adults as it is for children and all that, but I digress.
  
    I overheard their conversation last night when my sister was on a call with with Kylie's sister, and Kylie spotted my shelf with my Bluey merch in the background.  It went like so:
  
    Kylie: ""Bluey?!!""
  
    My sister: ""yeah, [my name] likes it.""
  
    This caused Kylie to let out a very demeaning laugh, and said ""Are you being serious?"" in a degrading tone, while still laughing.
  
    The whole thing left such a bad taste in my mouth, and I don't know if I'm overreacting by feeling really down about about it. Did I interpret what she said wrong, and is her reaction normal? Am I being overdramatic?

Not trying to self diagnose as I have a therapist but! I have been reflecting on my social behaviors recently and a lot of the traits seem to be in line with autism. I’ve made a list and was wondering if people had any insight/advice.
  
    -“performing” when I speak to people to appease them
  
    -difficulty understanding how other people feel about me socially
  
    -becoming upset when people not show interest in what I am talking about
  
    -always feel like I gave the “wrong” response in a conversation
  
    -Very particular special interests
  
    -Feel like i’m not listened to
  
    -Frequently change my cadence/tone/pitch depending on who I talk to
  
    -Difficulty with some loud noises as a child (ex: flushing a toilet)
  
    -often come off as too blunt or even “bitchy” when I feel like i’m stating a matter of fact without judgement  (this is a big one)
  
    -Strict routine as a child
  
    -Craving for abrasive media (harsh noise music, visually intense movies I.E climax - gaspar noé)
  
    -Occasionally overwhelmed by groups in unfamiliar settings
  
    -Difficulty relating to characters in film unless they physicalize their emotions to extreme lengths
  
    -Difficult maintaining eye contact
  
    -Platonic physical intimacy in general
  
    -Frequently feeling othered/alienated in social situation
  
    -Making certain faces and following different “paths” in social situations in response to other people
  
    I’ve been diagnosed and medicated for OCD in the past and my therapist has established that I have some level of social anxiety. I can’t tell if i’m conflating my anxiety with autism as a remedy for my problems but, I feel there are many signs that I can’t ignore although I will say I do not struggle with sensory issues like physical textures or crowds.

Before the rape I wasn’t overstimulated that often but after I just became more and more and to the point where every day everything feels like it is too much, and I am just finding out that it is because of the PTSD. My autism is way too overwhelmed with constantly feeling his touch and having flashbacks that it overstimulates me more, which inherently contributes to MORE flashbacks. Fun. I feel us autistic survivors should get credit for this because we have all of it, and I am just realizing this. The two issues are always making eachother worse and it feels terrible every time where I cannot find peace in my body at any certain time and it is certainly not fun. Neurotypical survivors already have the same issues of PTSD and the trauma and your body already feels so vulnerable and absolutely tainted but with those hypersensitivities from my autism you feel more of the trauma therefore making it so much more extremely overstimulating and it is just complete hell.
  
    Is this normal for autistic survivors??
  
    And I wonder how autism affects sexual assault in other ways, like a contributing reason to the way I froze and couldn’t speak, and went numb. And why I had a weird response early on of pushing away but also being super feminist at first and fixate on that stuff to try to convince it wasn’t my fault. Any thoughts?

Honestly any advice would be helpful right now, my usual coping mechanisms aren’t doing very much and I feel like I’m dying; my skin feels wrong and sounds and light is icky and everything is icky and it’s so hard to communicate and when I can’t I pause and yell because it’s so frustrating and my parents unintentionally mock me for it, I wanna tear my skin off and my limbs are just in my way and everything is ICKY I flinch and jump at every noise even if someone just starts talking and have to pause or even shout because it’s to much, this happens a lot but it’s just frustrating and I wanted to vent I guess.

    He has consistently taken my switch out of my room, as well as when hes been told hes not allowed to have it hell take it off the consol in the living room and hide in his room.
  
    Hell also just blatently try and take things hes been told no to like RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU and get really upset when you tell him no again.
  
    Its not only when he wants to do something, its when he doesnt want to too, he REFUSES to. He refuses to do a lot of basic health/cleanliness stuff, i CONSTANTLY have to tell him to chew with his mouth closed (as in ill ask him and literally ten seconds later hes doing it again) some of these are 100% just gross child things but that is not an excuse to let him just get away with them.
  
    Our parents are also trying to get him to realise that he needs to do these things but they simultaneously do the BARE MINIMUM and then they yell at him when he doesnt do it. Its only important to them when its inconveniencing them.
  
    His teachers also arent a whole lot of help, they at least consistently try to correct the behavior but they really just dont know how to deal with neurodivergent kids unless they are very high support needs, and even then they havent done the best job.
  
    Im graduating this year and planning on moving away ASAP, but i feel terrible leaving him here with people that are not teaching him how to be a good human (which is literally thier job).
  
    I have tried so many times to explain to him, directly and gently, WHY he has to do these things or why he CANT do these things, and he understands the gist of it (its bad for him if he doesnt, it makes people upset when you take/use thier stuff without permission, etc.) But he just genuinely doesnt understnd the fact that HE WANTS IT or HE DOESNT WANT TO DO IT doesnt make it okay.
  
    I really want to try and prepare him as much as i can for when im gone because i am his main support system right now, im the only one in this house that doesnt ignore him when i dont feel like dealing with him and the only one that doesnt swear at him and call him names; but i dont want him to think that the way he acts is okay.
  
    Tl;dr: my brother doesnt understand that if he wants to/doesnt want to do something, it doesnt mean he can do/not do it, how do i teach him that this isnt okay?

Because of my separation anxiety issues and Autism, making it very hard for me to get over failures, mistakes, and social misunderstandings, the breakup really upset me. We were so close, we shared everything, I went with her almost everywhere, I helped her out when she was in dire need, I was the only person around when she nearly died on different occasions, yet despite all this she said nothing about wanting to keep distance, she just got out of bed one night and walked to her room, and when I asked why she wanted distance she didn’t say why. Now we are just friends and it went from being close friends after she left being with me to now not even being around anymore, and only calling or messaging rarely. She spends time with her somewhat close friends and acquaintances, that are far from decent people, and I don’t understand why. I try to be normal, I try to gain approval and acceptance but it never goes that way ever. I told her that I have no one else only her, and I couldn’t handle her leaving, and she said I will get over it, bullshit. I am now very angry at her and am suicidal, and have to convince myself everyday not to do something erratic and permanent because I can’t get all the really crazy shit we went through and the connection we had, off my mind, and honestly I don’t want to let it go. I can’t just get over it, and have to self destruct to cope.

    For context I'm afro-latinx and I will admit that I'm a bit on the chubby side in terms of appearance, but my doctors have all said that my weight and blood pressure is perfectly fine, but despite that I do have a history of eating disorders as well as body dysmorphia and it really doesn't help that a lot of times my dad will make very unnecessary comments about my weight. I finally had enough confidence a bit ago to wear a one piece swimsuit for the first time since I was 9 years old, and then of course he had to go and make a comment about how I looked 'pregnant' and had a 'beer gut'; mom (who's actually older than him) pretty much flipped on him when he said that but even then I haven't worn anything like that since. Hell even when we go shopping, he'll go to the plus size section and find the largest pair of pants there and then say 'You're going to need this if you keep eating so much!', and the thing is he already knows that my eating disorder has gotten to a point where I only eat one meal a day.
  
    Secondly, I don't shave my legs very often because my sensory issues make me very sensitive to certain razors and types of shaving creams (I only do it about once every two to three weeks or so), so I was wearing basketball shorts the other day and since body hair for me tends to grow back very quickly, he of course had to make a stupid comment about how that combined with my thighs makes me 'look like a fat monkey', but the final straw for that was when he started touching my legs to make a point, so since I wasn't even in the mood to respond to that, I just flipped him off and stopped talking to him for the rest of the week. Even now I just have the need to hide my body from him, even if it means having to wear long pants and oversized shirts in the summer; he makes me feel so uncomfortable in my own body and I don't know what to do. I've talked to him about this, my mom even yelled at him because he thinks he's right and that I'm being a 'snowflake', I just wish he would shut up and mind his own business.

I suspected it myself for a while but tgen kinda ignored it, because my parents where very anti therapy and anti diagnosis. But looking back, it makes a lot more sense. So many details about me fit. My ""emotional outbursts"" that by my parents were always considered me acting out, where I would lose control over the things i said, where I'd violently cry, would hit myself and be overstimulated. How I've never gotten social cues, never get jokes and always was just 'different'. The way i can barely hold eye contact, and that only when I'm listening, or trying to. How so much of how i act is literally me just pretending to please the people around me, and so much more. It's like a whole new world just opened to me. I hope my doctor can help me figure things out further. But I'm honestly unsure how to prepare for something like this. If i get assessed, what do i need to know, how much research should i do? It's all just a bit overwhelming to me. I've struggled all my life, and I'm kinda terrified that in the end, there's nothing up anyway and i was just exaggerating or being dramatic.

The thing was it was RIGHT NEXT to the orchestra that was playing music. I left because it was too loud, but I came back 10 minutes later to try to power through the noise.
  
    By this time I was already tearing up, and I left to go into the art room to cry in a corner. Eventually my art teacher came by to ask if I was OK, and I told her I was sensitive to noise. She left me be and I eventually calmed down.
  
    Afterwards, I did enjoy the art show, mostly because I had my headphones on. I looked at all the nice artwork, but I called my dad to pick me up because I wanted to go home.

So he thinks these meltdowns are something I can control or get better at. I'm set to get tested later this month against his wishes as I need answers.
  
    When I go into one, my MO has always been to curl up in a weighted blanket, listen to my calm down playlist, and just sob and wail and maybe spasm. I used to self harm as a teen, but now I just draw or rub my skin. But he said the sobbing is disruptive (he is wfh) and distressing for him, especially as it can last all day or even be sporadic over a couple of days.
  
    What's frustrating is he keeps telling me I have to treat these in a ""healthier"" way. He always feels better by socializing and exercising. Which wow, great, but I point out to him that he has ADHD and stimulation famously soothes them (coffees send him to sleep). For me, the last thing I need is stimulation, and it's hard for me to ""journal"" or whatever else when I cant even form a word in my head or have the motor skills to write. But the frustrating is that he got tested twice for autism at a young age (how lucky he is to be a white boy), ended up with ADHD, and now has this weird idea that ""all neurodivergences are kind of the same"".
  
    The worst is that now when I'm in my house, I'm masking all the time because I'm so afraid of his judgement/exasperation.
  
    I'm just really sad and defeated. I've never met anyone who could tolerate my meltdowns, not even my own parents, and it's just proven to me again that it's a fundamentally unlovable aspect of myself.  I just wish someone could understand I really can't fucking help it!!

    my sister said i really only have myself to blame and that i shouldn't expect anybody to talk to me if i don't talk to anyone, but why should the initiation be entirely on my shoulders? it makes no sense to me. i look around at everyone being friends with each other and just wonder how it happened for them, and why didn't it happen for me? what is so wrong with me that it makes me unapproachable?
  
    normal advice doesn't work for someone who seems to have a genuine inability to initiate conversation (at least comfortably, and i feel like making a new friend should feel comfortable and not scary), but i know i can't just keep letting the world pass me by (my worst fear is ending up alone), so what should i do?

They are mid thirties. but I seriously need help understanding this.
  
    They became hyper fixated on a pain from scraping the back of their ankle with their own toenail. Whenever they get hurt they put a wet rag on it because that makes them feel better. They went full melt down on me, flushed skin to pale sweats and thrm demanding I put a bandage on it saying there was pain coming from a spot.
  
    I litterally could not find anything even using a flashlight that indicated any form of injury, took picture then video finally but nothing to prove to them there was not even a scuff of the spot. I placed the bandaid on and they went back to using a wet rag on the area.
  
    Can anyone help me understand this please.

127,The Oven conundrum as an illustration for how NTs and NDs communicate,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cipw87/the_oven_conundrum_as_an_illustration_for_how_nts/,4,1,2024-05-02 20:26:34.549000+00:00,"What I like to use to illustrate communication differences btwn NTs and NDs is what I call the ""oven conundrum"":
  
    You have to put some food in the oven for a specific amt of time. However the oven timer is not working. So you use your phone timer. Your partner asks: ""Did you put the timer on?""
  
    How do you respond?
  
    For most NTs it is a simple yes/no answer.
  
    For those on the spectrum we know we cannot give a simple yes/no answer.
  
    I have literally told my husband: ""I set my phone timer instead b/c the oven timer isn't working and I don't want you to expect a beep from the oven""
  
    Furthermore: If a ND person is the one asking: ""did you put the oven timer on?""
  
    And the NT person says: ""yes"" (when they used a phone timer instead)
  
    The ND person will reasonably assume that they should hear the OVEN beep at some point. (b/c they asked ""did you put the OVEN timer on?"") So when the phone goes off instead the ND person thinks ""why is their phone going off?"" And assume the NT person has LIED or tried to trick the ND person b/c they did not specify they were using a phone timer instead.

128,"my therapist mentioned i might have autism, how do i go about exploring it more?",https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ciz73b/my_therapist_mentioned_i_might_have_autism_how_do/,1,1,2024-05-03 03:46:49.112000+00:00,"i’m 13f. i’ve been going to therapy for 6 months, and about 4 months in she recommended me to get tested for ADHD. she put in the request, i took the test, and bam: no ADHD. i was really upset because i thought i had finally figured out what was making things so different for me, but i just felt like an imposter.
  
    after that, i got hooked on the idea that i might have autism in the same way i thought i had ADHD. see, even though she brought up the testing recommendation, i kinda purposely put the idea in her head without explicitly saying ‘i think i have ADHD.’ i just mentioned some of my symptoms every session for like a month and then she put it together. i was super scared of bringing it up independently because i was scared of being wrong, which i was. but ever since the ADHD test came back wrong, i’ve realized that a lot of the things ADHD doesn’t explain ASD does. along with my ADHD test was an IQ test, so we found out i’m gifted and that it might’ve delayed my social skills, so we’ve been working on social skills the past couple of sessions. i thought that this was a good start for subtly hinting at the fact i might have autism.
  
    today, i told her i kinda followed a script when making small talk. i gave her an example of how i kept asking people what music they were learning in band/orchestra because i didn’t know what else to say because that question was kinda part of my script. she looked at a few things, then said ‘maybe i got you tested for the wrong thing.’ and mentioned that she thinks i show signs of autism. she then asked me a couple questions that seemed to make her step back; she asked if i could read a room and then she asked me to describe what ‘sad’ and ‘angry’ were which didn’t make sense to me. then she asked if i understood humor, and i said yes, and then she went to say that she wasn’t going to put a label on it or put me in a box, but she thinks that many of the strategies that they use to help autistic people develop social skills could help me.
  
    the thing is is that i really want to talk about autism. a few months ago i started making a power point where i took the criteria of autism and dissected how i thought they related to me but i haven’t finished that yet because i want to add a bunch of other research yet and i procrastinate a lot. i also wanna tell her about my past and current hyperfixations and some weird things i do like suck my thumb and have temper tantrums/meltdowns even though i’m 13. i really want to explore it more with her but i’m super scared to bring it up because i don’t want to be wrong like how i was with ADHD. what should i do? i have a super hard time expressing exactly what i’m feeling/thinking and it often gets messages across the two of us incorrectly, so would the best idea be to complete the powerpoint with all the info i could possibly need so i don’t fault her when she asks me? or should i just go in and learn about it with her?

Their behavior hasn't changed with any of our roommates the silent treatment is strictly targeted towards me. 
  
    Needless to say I've been devastated by this sudden change, and my gut reaction here is too assume that somewhere along the lines I crossed an unspoken boundary and their response was to completely withdraw from our relationship instead of talking about it. But obviously I'm not autistic and I would really like to hear from people who might be able to give me some insight into what's actually going on and maybe even some advice on how to go about repairing our relationship if that's even possible.

Especially regarding my skin and noises, because I think I can deal with smell and photophobia well. Basically every week I'll come home one day or another and have a meltdown. It's seriously exhausting, I'm even missing classes because I can't deal with it. It's frustrating to see ""normal"" people being able to endure so much and just getting physically tired.
  
    I've done all I can to decrease/manage the stimuli: comfortable clothing, staying in places with air conditioning, stopping people from touching me, headphones, etc. But I need to know what to do when I'm reaching my breaking point, when that itch of a meltdown is around the corner. My current therapist is not specialized in this and frankly her advice only made things worse (she told me to exercise until I got physically exhausted too, and you can imagine how that sensation plus the heat and the sweat turned into a big meltdown).

I'm so. Fucking. sick of it. I go to a woke college where everyone is always cancelling each other, someone is alaways getting bullied online, and people are just overall shitty and lazy and constantly using mental health as an excuse to back out of committments. I am trying so fucking hard to focus on the positive and it is working, but I have seen these posters around my college that say ""do you feel like you belong here? 84% of students STRONGLY AGREE they feel like they belong here"" and it just feels so fucking beyond shitty that the overwhelming majority of people here feel like they belong and I don't. It invokes such deep pain. I have had so many terrible experiences at this school, because of my autism and difference of political opinion (I'm not even a Republican, I'm just not a woke degenerate asshole like most here) and the cancel culture and political intolerance has lead to constant friendship breakups, distrust, and anger. People still hold things that I said tow years ago against me, stupid political things about how COVID restrictions were too strict, and they had a very negative impact on my mental health so I went on a rant. I fucking apologized for it and have obviously moved on, and I focus on making new friends, but some of these friends have heard a lot of things about me (again, things that I said two years ago) and the fact that I had a mental breakdown (someone posted a recording of my voice during the breakdown and posted it on an anonymous app known as Fizz, and the comments were the most disgusting thing I've ever seen). So here I am, trying to MOVE THE FUCK ON and not think about the things in the past, but here people are bringing shit up about me that I did so long ago. I feel like ai'm putting in so much work and I have friends who really care about me, but if the overall environment is not supportive..... ugh it sometimes feels like... if I try so hard but others around me don't, what's the point (but I know I should keep trying, and I will) so yeah lol

    I also just want to mention that I do not want to self diagnose myself or assume anything and if these are all unrelated to autism or this post offends you in any way, please forgive me.
  
    Hi, around 8 months ago when i first started university, I made a really close friend, the only one person i could really be myself around here (like a safe person) [i moved for university]. We immediately clicked and were ourselves around each other and about 2 weeks- a month into the friendship she asked me if I was autistic. I said no and asked why she thought so. She told me that she noticed i do a lot of stuff that seem off to her in that sense like :
  


    being able to listen to the same song on repeat for hours or days on end
  


    Having always had to script my conversations (like introduction when i moved to a new school, phonecall to order food), and learn certain phrases or general responses to other phrases. If i make new friends who use different phrases I'm unfamiliar with i will see how other people or they respond to those types of phrases and then learn them and use them myself. Sometimes if someone texts me a phrase I've never heard of ill go through all my other chats or groupchats in general to see what people would have or have responded to similar or the same phrase and then use those and if i cant find it ill go onto google and if that doesn't work either ill just ask my friends and family.
  


    having to sit symmetrically opposite her anywhere because if were not directly opposite each other (if i feel like the midpoints of our bodies arent in line - i call it a longitudinal plane - it feels like the world is wrong and uneven). This is especially excruciating when i need to start work on my computer or sit somewhere because i always have to take a while to adjust myself into a plane that is symmetrical and feels right
  


    having sensory issues with clothes growing up and even now - certain textures like sequence, or it really depends cuz sometimes even cotton feels wrong on my skin depending on the clothing item and then i just wont wear it because now i feel like tearing my skin off. This also applies to if my clothes don't sit right on me - it could be a shirt I've worn a thousand times but sometimes it just feels a little bit tighter some places or just off and then i have to adjust and make it right or just change the shirt or clothing item all together. This also applies to food - i absolutely cannot stand mushy textures or even changes in textures for certain food like oats to a point where i will only buy one brand and eat it repeatedly cuz i know i like that texture and it feels safe and good.
  


    once we were in a mall and they started playing forest noises and my friend found it calming but i was severely disturbed and told her that its because i can hear like 80 different mini noises in this one big sound (i can hear the smallest and farthest noises immediately and sometimes it bothers me because i can hear the clock ticking and now I'm distracted because the ticking is so loud and never ending and it makes me wish i could stop time all together)
  


    I have to walk up and down in my room (in a set linear path that i set for myself) in the morning before i leave for uni and before i got to bed (cant go to bed without at least an hour of this) and also in between tasks. I could finally get up to use the washroom in between my work (i like to wait till my bladder physically hurts for some reason or till i feel like I've earned it idky) and when i come back i cant sit back to work without walking for at least 20 mins. I literally wake up 2 hours before i really need to for uni just to be able to walk and i thought this was normal because its calming. She also noticed I do this thing with my fingers where I like to trace my nails with my thumb all the time but I thought that was normal? Sometimes if I know I'm going to be doing something super nerve-wracking I like to keep my nails long and press them into my palm really hard because the pain kinda calms me down.
  


    She thinks its weird that before i eat something i will segregate and eat my food from ""least satisfactory bite"" to ""most satisfactory bite"" or when I'm eating something with slices or diff pieces like a pizza i have to eat from smallest to biggest slice or the world feels wrong. Sometimes if I'm eating a frozen pizza or sm i will purposely cut the slices a bit unevenly so its easier for me to tell smalest to biggest.
  


    I always eat my sandwiches crust first (fully) the inside and stick icecream that have those chocolate layers in the same way - always full outer layer and then inner layer or its wrong.
  


    Once we wanted to divide notes for one of our tests and she told me to start from the 9th topic onwards and that made me feel like the whole number order is now disrupted and that not how things are supposed to be so i did her part of the notes too so ic ould start from no 1.
  


    I had horrible separation issues from my mother as a child to a point where it was hard for my mom to get me to school or even social gathering because i would hate any sort of party or group gathering as a child to a point where id cry and itd end with my mom and i sitting out of it together. - this is actually the reason that when i was a kid my aunt in one of her raging sessions accused me of being the reason her child is autistic. Her child is diagnosed with autism and is non-verbal.
  


    I have been picked on by classmates and even teachers literally since playschool (or pre-kg as they'd call it where i was from) -> which my friend said is apparently a sign?
  


    I was never taught how to read by my mom but i could read by the age of 3 and i just learnt by picking up phrases from the kids shows id watch and apply them to my books. Also my mom would read to me everyday so i just picked it up through that too.
  


    All my friendships since kindergarten were me having this one safe person that i follow around everwhere kinda like a mother duck? This also resulted in me not being able to end my friendship with my best friend in highschool because i was so comfortable with her (even her bad treatment towards me) and i was scared id never be close enough with someone else or no one else would accept me like she did (luckily i recently discovered that's not true)
  


    I always have too much anxiety before trying new things that i need someone there to be with me and help me along (even basic life tasks like withdrawing money for the first time or going to the doctor by myself - sometimes this results in me putting really important errands off for months on end even though i feel horrible about it but it feels paralyzing when I think of actually going to get that job done). However, I've suffered with anxiety in general whether that is to leave the house (since i was a child - way before covid too), especially in crowds.
  


    Back in school when I would write in notebooks (thankgod I use an iPad now) if there was something I thought was even a little off (like the curve of my g or the dot on my i - god forbid a spelling mistake) I would rip the whole page off and rewrite it as many times as I'd have to for it to be perfect.
  


    Now the thing is i keep denying it even now but for as long as i can remember since i was a child and since my aunt accused me my mother would say she was proud of me for outgrowing my weird autistic like behaviours as a child like how she taught me to make eye contact and actually say hello to people so i don't look mean. And the weird thing is a week ago I was having a normal conversation with one of my friends flatmates who was actually diagnosed with autism when he was a kid, and he straight up asked me at the end of it - ""you're a little bit autistic arent you?"" and i was like huh??? no I'm not and i asked him why he thought so and he said he could just feel it. At this point my other friend is convinced I'm autistic even though i don't think so but i don't know. I want to ask my therapist about this but i don't want to look like a poser or like I'm just begging to be diagnosed with something you know? I just want to know why the only girl who has ever really seen or heard of my behaviours is convinced I'm neurodivergent ( i have never revealed these habits of mine or explicitly behaved this way in front of others and tend to hide it for some subconscious reason). Please some advice would be highly appreciated and I'm really sorry for ranting :)

135,So I suspect I may be autistic (Sorry for the long post),https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ciyw7r/so_i_suspect_i_may_be_autistic_sorry_for_the_long/,1,1,2024-05-03 03:30:10.577000+00:00,"TLDR: I have issues maintaining relationships (except with my boyfriend and mom). My mom sometimes would tell me to invite my friend over, I sometimes don't understand jokes/sarcasm, didn't understand how to make friends, a picky eater, only have at most 3 consistent hobbies (if you want to count youtube as one), preference to have male friends (get along better) instead of females, prefer to do things alone/be alone, grew up being known as shy/quiet (I started breaking out of my shell when I was 17), would feel stressed when my sister came over unannounced (but I also have some personal issues with our relationship), there's a facial expression I do from someone I used to hang out with
  
    I've had multiple times (even online) where I was hoping so desperately that I'd make a friend, some even sharing the same interest/hobby as me, then it not working out and I'm left stressed out, maybe even crying (specifically with one person who had the same exact hobby as me, a hobby I spend a lot of time with)
  
    Just need to say, at the moment I do not have any friends. I have an online friend who doesn't talk that much/not at all to me anymore (I think because they're busy) and a few acquaintances in a discord group. My boyfriend has friends that I consider to be friends, but I do not have their contact (which I'm perfectly fine with)
  
    **Something I really want to emphasize: I thought you had to breathe manually when I was young (and first diagnosed with a panic disorder)
  
    So I have some suspicions that I may be autistic. I'm already diagnosed with Bipolar 1 (diagnosed at age 20) and panic disorder (diagnosed at age 12). I also have an unspecified sleeping disorder (I usually sleep in bursts of 2-3hrs, rarely 4, sometimes I'll wake up every hour)
  
    When I was a kid (around 8 years old) I saw my parents had more food then I did and went to grab more. I wasn't hungry but I was afraid I wasn't eating enough.
  
    I've always been known to not always understand jokes or sarcasm
  
    I didn't understand how to make friends, I had a few though. One of them being diagnosed with aspbergers (which from what it seems is now called autism). They had told me multiple times that something was off about me when we were kids.
  
    I only really felt like I got the whole friend and socializing thing altogether when I was 18 (senior year high school). Which even then they weren't people I spent time with outside of school.
  
    This is gonna sound weird, but when I was a kid (around the same time I was first experiencing panic attacks) I thought you had to breathe manually.
  
    As an adult I am:
  
    A picky eater -hate the texture of almost all meat
  
    Have very few hobbies - I am obsessed with Hatsune Miku, Project Diva (her rhythm gane series) and rhythm games in general. Sometimes it feels like the only thing I spend my time with. I have a hard time getting into new games and just default back to that same game (which I've been playing the series since 2015 on a regular basis) and might switch over to another rhythm game, which is not a thing I do often. I spend a lot of time on YouTube.
  
    I much more prefer male friends over female, I get along with guys easier (although as it is I don't really have feminine hobbies, most I do is paint my nails, (enough to consider it a hobby) and every now and then play with my makeup
  
    I have a hard time keeping and maintaining relationships. Actually, when I was a kid, my mom would sometimes tell me to invite my friend (the same one who suspected something about me, we hung out on a regular basis) to come over.
  
    With that being said I have a preference of being alone and doing my own thing. I don't mind having my boyfriend over though.
  
    Growing up I've always been the shy and quiet type. However my mom said when I was young I would talk a lot (not sure how young, but I don't remember being a yapper, so probably fairly young?)
  
    It would stress me out when my sister would come over unannounced (I was also having some personal issues with her), hasn't been much of an issue anymore thankfully
  
    I have difficulty smiling naturally, I've noticed I have to force expressions at times. There's a facial expression that I do that someone I used to hang out with regularly would do

    i've been doing fine lately and haven't gotten overstimulated in a while. but today for some reason, everything is pissing me off and i'm on the edge of screaming.
  
    it started with my sister CONSTANTLY coughing this morning - she is dependent on nasal spray which makes constant nasal drip in the back of her throat. i've tried to tell her over and over that it really bothers me and overwhelms me, but she doesn't listen. she has misyphonia (i think i spelled that wrong sorry), so she should be able to try to understand that it's as frustrating as when someone bites their lip, eats loudly, or picks at their nails around her. but she isn't trying at all to hear me out.
  
    i went to a coffee place today too. an alarm on one of the machines had this really abrasive and loud tone to it, and went off two separate times. and then a blender turned on all of the sudden and i jumped and just told my s/o im gonna wait for our order in the car. then i tried to tell my partner about how ive been very overwhelmed all day, but they interrupted me and asked if i wanted my sandwich i ordered. i was not upset at that because they have adhd, so they sometimes are just not sure when to interject and ask questions at an appropriate time. we're both working on that. but it DID throw me out of the loop for a second, and took me a few moments to gather myself before i could continue.
  
    basically, if this was any other day of the week, and all of this happened, i would be less overwhelmed. most of the time, that shit gets really annoying, but it doesn't send me into a bad mood all day and scare/anger the shit out of me. i just wanna scream. right now my cat is grooming himself on me and it's really cute but if he doesn't stop soon and sleeps i am gonna throw him off me. lol. p.s. the constant slowing down/speeding up of traffic was also really pissing me off too. wtf is up with that?!
  
    does anyone else experience this? where on some days you can handle almost all the stimuli around you and other days you just feel like going insane and screaming your head off?

My OCD was only Identified clinically at the end of March while at hospital. I have a long report on my OCD on my records.
  
    Today, over a month after I was discharged from hospital for extreme anxiety and OCD the mental health services finally saw me for the first time in months.
  
    They had previous got me diagnosed with ADHD, and we've been going through the process to get ADHD medication, issue is that I have extreme white coat syndrome with bad panic attack when my blood pressure or heart rate is taken, with crying, hyperventilating and rapid heart beat, so it's incredibly difficult to get my heart checked, although even in that state still I'm only in Prehypertension. They told us today they were going to refure me me to get a more indepth look at my heart where they take into account all my family history and all that jazz.
  
    At the appointment I was asking if they could look into ERP or other treatments for anxiety besides medication. I was told that therapy wouldn't work for me because of autism, something I'm not diagnosed with yet. They told me they won't do anything till the end of they month when I get autism assessment results. They generally just told me therapy won't work and only medication will actually help with my anxiety, but won't prescribe me medication until I get conformation my hearts ok, because of the really really rare(and they themselves said it was really rare) chance SSRIs can affect your heart if you already have a heart condition.
  
    I'm struggling so hard right now, I haven't gone to school in two weeks because of anxiety and I've isolated myself from every one, outside my sibling and dad. Even my own phyco therapist says therapy won't help my anxiety and dosent do anything to work on my anxiety.
  
    I don't know what I'm ment to do, it will likely be months before I can start medication, and even then I can only start one medication at a time. I don't know what to do. I don't even want to be medicated that much, and the process is stressful.

144,I would like some advice about what to do next,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cixhpr/i_would_like_some_advice_about_what_to_do_next/,1,2,2024-05-03 02:16:02.704000+00:00,"Hi ! I'm new to Reddit and I have not used this website very much at all prior to currently. I would just like some advice as I'm in what I'd feel is a difficult situation. I have not gone to school for 3 months. The reason why is because I recently moved to a new school at the start of this year, however I just found that I literally could not function at this school. I'm fine with the idea of going from class to class, I love going to class and learning, I love going home and learning. But it's just the people; I can't function in a massive pool of random kids that I don't know.
  
    I feel paralyzed when people I don't know look at me. I feel paralyzed when people I don't know try to talk to me. I feel like I can't think because someone is sitting behind me. I feel like I'm going to run away from school when a random kid randomly touches me. But I love learning. I do want to keep going to school. But I cannot even think around new people. I cannot even function. I started wearing a mask again because it's overwhelming when people look at my face and assume how I'm feeling based on my face. Another kid in my year group is open about having ADHD and gets made fun of for it all the time. I don't want friends, I don't feel like I need a ""place"" or interaction. I was fine at my old school living in my own world. But there's no corner of the school with no people. I try to find a place for myself but people will still see me, sometimes they will approach me, sometimes they will start whispering and saying things about me. I just want to be left alone, I just want to be invisible, and I feel completely exhausted and occupied and disabled simply being in the presence of people I don't know. I feel bad when they talk to me because sometimes they're nice people and they probably deserve a response, but wont be getting one because I'm too paralyzed by being dumped in a supermassive pool of new kids. The school ""tried"" to accommodate for me but I eventually got kicked out of the school because I wasn't showing up.
  
    My mother really wants me to go back to school. It's not like I hate learning, it's not like I hate school. I liked going from class to class, I liked showing up to school, but there were less people (not to mention that they were people I'd been around for years and years and gotten used to) and more space. I could sort of manage to get work done because I had more space, and the teachers started letting me access an alternative room to escape the class full of noisy kids, despite my teachers sometimes not wanting to ""give me special treatment."" At my old school, I was comfortable enough with my classmates and my teachers that I could get up and approach the teachers with a question. At my new school, Sometimes I'll need help from the teacher in class, but I can't put my hand up, I can't talk, I can't stand up, I can't move, I feel like I can't even breathe, I can't do anything, I kind of just stare at her and hope she looks my way. But then after awhile I stop trying to get her attention because she'll get mad at me for being so far behind in class, having been waiting for her assistance.
  
    It's not like I necessarily hate people, they're just super overwhelming, and I can't be bothered trying to get them to understand or sympathize with me, as they may say I'm ""overreacting (I know I kind of am but it's not something I can control),"" ""faking it"" or just stop treating me like a human being. The kids in my year group seemed a lot more mean and rowdy than the other higher or lower year groups. On the first day there, I was thrown trash at by a kid in my class for just wearing a mask. I know I am sensitive. This year I am not going to achieve the standard that I was supposed to this year, because I've just been sleeping the months away. Usually I get at least a year above on all subjects even without putting so much effort in. Online schooling is hard because my computer is really old and I get distracted online very easily. I get exhausted staring at a screen all day. I prefer doing bookwork in a room away from home, preferably away from others.
  
    I like being alone, I prefer it that way. There are some people I like to chat with or spend time with, but I am for the most part socially anxious and not interested in making new friends. I would just also prefer not to make enemies, either. I am a sensitive person, I get easily hurt by someone saying something jokingly to me as I sometimes can't tell when people are joking, making jaunts or taunts at me, etc. It's not something I know how to shut off or improve as I've always been consistently like that. It's hard for me to talk to my family about these things as my father is also very sensitive and turbulent, and my mother is quite intense and has been quite abusive to me in the past. People tell me that I need to get over my ""limitations"" to function in the real world. I know I can easily achieve more than enough of what I need to, I just get very depressed, burnt out, anxious and stressed and I have frequently caved in and attempted throughout my life when I am forced to put up with situations and environments that disadvantage me and stunt my ability to function in day to day life.
  
    Does anyone have any advice? It's hard to access therapy and professional help; It's expensive, the lineup is massive, I am incredibly bad at communicating in person or over call, and I find it hard to open up and trust people immediately, even knowing that it's for my own good. I don't have many friends and I don't have much family I personally trust. I don't require an extensive social life to be happy. In fact, the happiest times of my life are when I was left alone to pursue and explore my own things by everyone. Maybe you could call me antisocial, but it doesn't mean I am unhappy. If I want to talk to someone, I'll know it when I look at them.Thanks for reading !! Sorry, I'm one of those people that doesn't really know how to dumb things down into simpler words immediately.

But that included ""powering through"" my sensory issues. Now I'm miserable and simultaneously emotionally spent while emotionally overwhelmed. I can't tell what I want or need because my wants and needs have been so belittled and compared to neurotypical children that I either can't identify it or I if I'm lucky to figure it out I feel like I failure to exist.
  
    I just wish I could have been accommodated just once. I wish they didn't tell me that I was spoiled for not even having all my basic needs met. And I wish someone could see the suffering I feel inside everyday, that everything I feel, see, hear, and smell, pushes me over the edge.
  
    I lost my point in making this. I'm just so hopelessly drowning. I'm in therapy and it doesn't help yet. I get so jealous that kids get to thrive when I got to get stuck pretending to be normal. I've been crying for hours and hours and I just want it all to go away

    I have been contemplating the challenges I encounter with communication, particularly under conditions of stress or fatigue. Despite extensive therapy and freaking too much academic exposure to a field related to psychology (lol) I find myself at times utterly unable to utilize the communication strategies I have learned 🙃 Sometimes I suddenly feel like  a 5 years old.💀 These episodes often manifest as either emotional meltdowns or complete withdrawal where the tools for effective communication seem inaccessible. Is this skill regression?
  
    Im curious to learn if others have experienced similar challenges. If so, how do you navigate these occurrences?
  
    Additionally, these episodes frequently provoke a deep sense of shame in me... If you have encountered similar feelings, how do you manage them?

    I'm noticing a very clear pattern where days that cause sensory overload and social fatigue (sunny weather, whole day at the office, lots of interruptions, lots of noise) result in me binge eating later in the day or fighting against the urge to the point of having to sit with it in tears for hours (or rather curl into a ball, not sit). The emotional toll is big even when I manage to resist. It's not nice to remember yourself crying hysterically because you were fighting yourself. In contrast, days with stress that does't result from sensory overload or social fatigue (for instance full day of working at home even if the task is difficult) don't usually trigger this severe response.
  
    Do any of you have experience with this kind of pattern? Did you find strategies to manage this?

I have been unemployed for half of my adult life. The times I have been employed, I was never able to make anything close to sustainable. I'm 30 years old. Every time I try to work, I become burned out or just go deeper into my never ending burn out. Often, even part time and ""flexible"" jobs seem to be too much for me.
  
    I find it hard not to compare myself to other autistic adults who can financially support themselves and even enjoy their jobs. I've been financially dependent on others my entire life, and it gives me massive anxiety.
  
    I was late diagnosed with autism & ADHD. I don't know what level I am. I've learned how to do things like clean after myself, ride the bus, cook, etc. If I had an unlimited amount of money, I could probably survive on my own.
  
    But I can't seem to work. It's painful. It disturbs my routines. I feel like I have no focus or energy to take care of myself if I have a job. I also have a hard time switching between working and not working. If I have a work shift, I can't think about anything else other than preparing for the upcoming shift and then once I'm home, it's hard to focus on relaxing or doing other necessary things. So even a part time job is overwhelming. I need extended periods where I don't have any commitments because being ripped away from hyperfocus is painful. If I know I don't have a long stretch of time, I feel like I can't do anything at all.
  
    Completing university was excruciating for me, and I barely made it out alive (with lots of accommodations). I feel like I'm still dealing with burnout from all those years ago.
  
    It's hard to ever relax and recover from burnout knowing that I eventually I have to get a job or figure out how to make enough money. Work makes me miserable. My mental health always ends up spiraling.
  
    Has anyone else experienced this sort of distress when it comes to work? What is someone like me to do?

    Preparing food (everything is slimy)

Looking into it myself I feel like I see a lot of signs of being on the spectrum in myself. Speaking to friends about it they agree. Lately, I’ve been in a very stressful work environment that is leaving me very overwhelmed/overstimulated and angry. I have a hard time of getting over things. I’m looking to read more to help understand myself better and to be able to help myself. Thank you

163,I finally did it - I passed my driving test and got my licence! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cigots/i_finally_did_it_i_passed_my_driving_test_and_got/,7,1,2024-05-02 14:11:44.242000+00:00,"So in September 2022 the boyfriend and I moved in together. The local traffic app said my way to the office should be fine at 45 minutes maximum... Turns out in reality it's 1.5 hours if the busses etc. arrive on schedule, which they normally don't. This adds a huge amount of stress to my daily life.
  
    So in October of 2022 I decided I would finally do it at then 30 years old and get my licence. I had never needed it before. I always got by fine with public transportation and walking. Also I was so scared of driving a car, that even thinking about it almost made me panic. Driving felt so incredibly overwhelming and overstimulating that there were a few times where I almost gave up.
  
    But here I am today. More than 1.5 years, one failed practical exam, many, many tears, 60 x 45 minutes of practical lessons and 6.500 Euros later... This morning I finally passed my test! And I even did so well that the examiner complimented me.
  
    I am so incredibly relieved. This will allow me to be so much more independent. I don't need to rely on others to drive me anymore. I don't have to wait 30 minutes in the pouring rain just for trains or busses to be canceled. (I know that cars are not the best for the environment and if it was more practical and most importantly reliable and wouldn't take more than twice the time to get to the office I wouldn't have bothered with a licence.)
  
    So if any of you are in a similar situation and you're totally overwhelmed and even scared of driving, maybe if I can do it, you can do it too! :)

I'm diagnosed with ASD and I'm looking into assessment for ADHD. When I did my ASD diagnosis, they said I didn't meet ADHD criteria because I didn't struggle with attention so it must all just be executive functioning issues. At the time, I agreed with it, but now that I'm unmasking and regressing a bit, I'm realizing that the only reason I don't struggle with attention is because I have systems in place and without those, I wouldn't have it. Because of autism, I have the self-disapline enough to make it a routine and actually follow those systems to a point where I don't struggle too much, but I feel like that's just autism masking ADHD. I can give examples of systems I use to make my attention not get bad if you guys need it, but my real question is that when I'm filling out ADHD assessment screaners, am I supposed to pretend I don't have those systems in place? Or if you have systems in place does that mean you don't struggle cuz you figured it out? Obviously once I get in front of a human I'll explain that the systems are masking the inattentiveness.

But I do feel that I may be autistic in how I relate to AM (not saying that's the only reason I think so). I feel like a robot pretending, or at least wishing to be human, to be able to experience the world like others can, to be able to feel emotions like them.

That's messed up. he's a kid with special needs, but a father shouldn't feel like he is being bullied. it isn't great.
  
    ""i don't care. i want it now, you big idiot"" but on top of it all, the kid still tries to comfort him, or thinks the world of him, but it's like he is in a toxic relationship.
  
    I'm angry for him. that kid does not get how much of a struggle the dad tries to do for him. and what was all the bullying for? because he had to wait 20 minutes as he is driving, and he is getting anxiety, and he took the game from him, but the kid will just play mind games. it's ODD.
  
    but look, there has to be some kind of line, because speaking as another person on the ASD. No one can tolerate bullying, no matter what size. words build up, I'm getting angry for him. my friend is doing good. he doesn't deserve this. so what do parents do?
  
    if you want to effing see it as me being ignorant, then I am asking for the future, cause I'm sure if I have a kid, it won't be much of a different experience with a kid I have in the future. I'm not sure I was any better to deal with as a kid. there's parellels, and I can see myself being the dad right now, and so I don't get what you do when you're kid is flat out bullying you.

    Recently I watched a program about kids in Autralia having trouble going to school, particularly those with Autism,Adhd and Anxiety disorders. I found this particularly interesting because I can relate to this practically having left school around 12/13 for the same reasons which is simply that I couldn't cope with it. I'm wondering if that has changed at all and how common it is for those on the spectrum to have trouble with the school & work settings in general, from what I've seen it is pretty common and I'm wondering why nothing is being done to help people. In the program, it stated that mental health support costs much more rather than helping those who need it in the first place, so why not help and save money? Perhaps it's because they don't know how to help. What are all of your thoughts on this?

How do I go from here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cit2fp/tw_vent_25_in_severe_autistic_burnout_since_fall/,1,6,2024-05-02 22:41:04.842000+00:00,"Context: Late diagnosed autistic AFAB, in university (5th year, 3 majors + certificate) struggling to complete any coursework. Terrified of failure and being a terrible student/child.
  
    Hi, this is my first post on here and I need some help/advice. I'm a university student and grades are due on May 10th. I'm basically behind for the entire semester and I, just now, began to catch up. I know I'm probably screwed and will fail this semester...but how do I deal with failing? I think my burnout started when I did my study abroad (2022-2023) knowing that I was potentially autistic (boy, did it become more obvious). It only got worse as I faced a major post-surgical complication and then another major surgery that led me to withdraw from my fall semester. I thought this semester I would be okay...I'm not. I basically feel like the ""TONY STARK WAS ABLE TO BUILD THIS IN A CAVE!"" sound, constantly thinking of how hard I was able to push myself before ever knowing I was autistic. I can't do that anymore. I have disability accommodations, and regardless I was just not able to turn in. any. work. I hate myself for what I've become. From dean's list to now flunking with no good excuse other than ""it's autistic burnout, womp womp.""
  
    I emailed my professors and one is willing to give me an incomplete if I do 50% of the assignments (opposed to 80%) and one essay. The other 2 have not gotten back to me, and I'm too scared to message the other one. When I say, no coursework I mean: NO COURSEWORK. I'm ashamed. I never used to be like this and it's not on purpose...I would sit down and do my ""homework"" routine (study music, candle, comfortable environment, etc.), open the assignments and do the reading and take notes and I could never go beyond that, I didn't understand what I was reading even if I read it over and over again. I couldn't write a basic 3 page analysis paper. I couldn't reply to discussion questions. I would sit for 2-3 hours trying to understand and complete the work and nothing came out ""right.""
  
    I don't know how to get past this. I keep reading that I just ""have to go through it."" That I can't rush going through burnout, and that I shouldn't push myself to do things I'm really struggling to do. I've always been good at school...so to be where I am now is so devastating. I've spent this entire semester lying to my family saying I'm doing well, I'll graduate next year in the spring (I've been uni for 5 years now). I don't know how to tell my mother and father that I failed. Not because of my chronic illnesses or a surgery, but because of my autism. I have withdrawn before for medical reasons...but this feels worse. I did this. I failed. I don't know how much of this I can (or should) attribute to my autism diagnosis that changed my life in September of 2023.
  
    I needed to get this off my chest. I don't know what to do know, how to tell my family, how to prepare for the failed grades or try to pass, and how to recover from this burnout, this hell, I'm in. Any advice or support would be appreciated. I really feel like I'm just alone, like it's all my fault, and like this could have been prevented if I was smarter or more organized...
  
    Thank you for reading.
  
    Note: [I am safe, and my family situation is good other than this anxiety I have surrounding my grades and potentially having to push my graduation back again. I love my parents.]

191,University as an autistic person?,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ciljm7/university_as_an_autistic_person/,2,4,2024-05-02 17:30:53.503000+00:00,"I’m in year 12 at a UK grammar school and we are being encouraged to consider university applications. I am autistic, have Tourette’s syndrome and quite bad anxiety (all diagnosed) but get really good grades (as in, I’m likely to get three A*s in my next set of mocks). I feel like it would be such a waste not to go to university, and I know my teachers and parents expect me to. I also know I am perfectly academically capable. However, I need a lot of help emotionally from my support circle at school and I experience sensory issues, struggle with routine changes, struggle with socialising, and really all the things you would expect of an autistic person. But this is all on top of having Tourette’s, meaning I have a really hard time in quiet environments, especially one with many people. My tics, from time to time, may get as severe as shouting and screaming. They are usually not as severe but always present.
  
    All of this seems like a recipe for disaster when it comes to thriving in university. There seems to be much less support from teachers and staff, which I really rely on, and a huge social aspect. I often have to leave school on bad days, but at university I would not have that option as I’d either be away from home or have to commute home from London, which is borderline unsafe when overloaded/in the midst of a meltdown or shutdown. It seems as though you have to be very self-motivated at university, which I also struggle with. Don’t even get me started on halls of residence - on a day when my tics are playing up, I can’t think of anything worse than being trapped in a tiny room, which is also the only place I have to myself. I am quite positive that other students would be able to hear my tics.
  
    Honestly, I wish I could just kickstart my career without a degree, but I‘d feel so guilty letting down my teachers and family who tell me I could go to Oxford if I wanted to. I want to be an author, and have nearly finished my first MG novel. I’ve made good progress with a publisher, too, especially for my age. But I also appreciate how important a degree is in getting somewhere with life.
  
    Any thoughts?

    I can't not take things literally. It's not that I am not empathetic: if somebody actually words what they feel, I am able to connect and respond accordingly.
  
    NT's aren't all stupid, so there must be a purpose. It feels like they don't need to exactly word it out, because there is another dimension of communication that is transmitted seperately 🤷‍♂️ NT's have access to this dimension, but I don't. As if I am not able to see the obvious.
  
    So.. is this dimension actually a thing? Or is there another explanation? I am genuinly interested and trying to understand.
  
    Also: whenever I say exactly what I mean, it often happens that they assume some bigger or hidden meaning in my words which just isn't there. It's insanely frustrating. I am not frustrated by them, but by my inability to see what they see.

I really hate it. I only just taught myself how to become apathetic when emotions become too damangingly strong for me to handle so it just feels like 50 steps back to when I was a teenager. It really sucks and sadly it's kind've always been this way for me. I either am able to bring the best out of people or if I am in a mood or unable to cooperate I bring the absolute worst out of someone. I often get the sense that the adults around me don't accept that I am developmentally delayed, I get spoken to like I can control myself when I'm overwhelmed by stimuli and when I try explaining it's always brushed off as me trying to argue when I really am not. Sometimes I feel it's best if I just go willingly mute, so much conflict and confusion could be avoided if I just wouldn't talk or speak my mind or anything that comes from me really. I'm feeling pretty bummed out by these thoughts lately, which is really lame because I actually had a pretty good evening today so it's just ruined a bit for me. I feel like I'm not allowed to refer back to my hinderances with autism or anything because it's an ""excuse"". I really do hate the terms ""excuse, acting, immature"" etc. I'm really tired of all this. Could this be a possible sign of mask burnout? I don't know how often I mask myself but lately I've been trying to be on my *absolute* best behavior. I just kind've wish I lived alone, maybe then no one would be hurt by my words or feel like they have to walk on eggshells around me and vise versa. It just feels like everyone *loves* me when I'm in a good mindset but when something nasty comes around? No one wants to deal with me or cares to help me understand and make sense of stuff.

I am feeling so many things. Last week, my son who is eight years old, was attacked by a high school kid who is nonverbal and autistic. This took place on the way to school about an hour after school started. Dad and I both got a phone call telling us to come to the school immediately as our son was being transported to Children’s Hospital for suicidal threats. My husband and I rushed to the school. When we got there, our eight year-old son collapsed in my arms. He was bawling his eyes out and mommy school is not a safe place. He said this in front of his teacher and guidance counselor they didn’t really ask him, what happened to him if something was going on at home. They tried to say school is a safe place. We don’t know why he saying that. It wasn’t until we got to the hospital that we found out about the attack to which they checked his whole body. While my son was looking out the window, the autistic child reached over to my son Dug, her nails into the top of his head. Then she grabbed his head and shook him violently. All of this was caught on video. The company called us saying they’d watch the video and confirmed everything that had happened to him. The district however, is trying to minimize it and saying that well the kid is autistic and nonverbal so nothing really needs to be done. They said if we want anything done, we will have to press charges, but who would do that to a special needs kid. That special needs kid though hurt my kid not just physically, but psychologically also. Tomorrow we are going to review the footage. I’m just at last at what to do looking for help from anyone who might understand the situation thanks.

    For example my roommate used my dry shampoo (finished it off) and so when i went to use my dry shampoo obviously there wasn’t any. There’s nothing i can do in that situation except buy some more but i didn’t have time and didn’t have time to wash instead either so i had to accept the greasy hair.
  
    This one thing had such an impact on my day because I was out of control of what my hair looked like, the fact that it was a bit greasy felt awful and i kept having to wash my hands cause my whole body felt greasy and disgusting. I was genuinely very upset and stressed over something like that that most people would be a lil upset about but then accept it and move on.
  
    I think the main point of this post is whether or not a behaviour or feeling that is related to my autism can be changed. It really causes me a lot of distress when I don’t feel in control i can’t just let go and go with the flow and I know I come across as very uptight. Am I gonna feel this way forever or is there anything I can do?

217,Seeking Advice: Considering NYC Nest Program ,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cikr64/seeking_advice_considering_nyc_nest_program/,1,3,2024-05-02 16:58:07.142000+00:00,"My family and I are in the process of relocating from NJ to Maryland in June, and we're actively researching elementary school options for our children. However, we're facing a dilemma regarding one of our kids, who recently received acceptance into the NYC nest program, specifically designed to serve students with autism.
  
    We're conflicted about whether to stay in New York, as both his current preschool staff and prospective school staff have spoken highly of the nest program, emphasizing its excellence and the challenge of securing acceptance. However, it's worth noting that the NYC school where he was accepted into the nest program will be implementing it for the first time this year.
  
    If we move to Maryland, our plan was to enroll him in a ""mainstream"" class or the equivalent of an Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) class.
  
    We're torn between the NYC nest program and exploring a new school in Maryland. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated as we navigate this decision.

218,What would have helped you as a kid?,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1cikr3n/what_would_have_helped_you_as_a_kid/,0,4,2024-05-02 16:58:02.387000+00:00,"I have an almost 13yo AuDHD child (currently questioning their identity so I'm going to stay gender neutral for now) and they actively want therapy. We had a major meltdown at 1am about something that wouldn't seem to an outsider to be meltdown-worthy. This morning I asked if it was okay for me to look around for a talk therapist, to which the response was ""yes, I need one.""
  
    (I've always been extremely open and honest about my own experiences with therapy and how it has often helped me so it doesn't have the stigma in our house that it might in the outside world.)
  
    Anyway, I'm extremely wary of therapists who claim to specialize in autism because that whole thing seems fraught. But at the same time, a therapist who isn't accounting for it might get frustrated or upset and cause a different kind of damage.
  
    Basically the one skill I really would like my kid to learn (for my sake and theirs) is how to be okay when things are different, or unexpected, or rationally disappointing (we can't afford to go out to eat this week), or only mildly disappointing (they're out of blueberry muffins, but you can have any other flavor.)
  
    I'm AuDHD myself and I know how full of disappointment life can be, and at home I've become so afraid of the meltdowns and tantrums (yes I do recognize the difference) that I very often give in and go way out of my way to accommodate. I know this is probably unhealthy parenting on my part but it's a self-preservation instinct.
  
    But there are going to be some major changes coming up in their life that they're going to be very upset about. And every day has a bunch of minor disappointments or obstacles that they struggle with.
  
    So is a talk therapist a good idea? Will CBT or DBT or ACT even work, or will it just be teaching harmful masking techniques? Is it possible for an adolescent with AuDHD to learn to let go of what they want things to be and accept them as they are?
  
    I'm asking because I lean much more heavily on ADHD and my kid leans much more heavily on the autism side and one of the things that helped me was hitting a mental health rock bottom and I definitely do not want them to go that route.
  
    Any advice you might have would be incredibly kind.

    I (27non-binary) am married to my wife (27f), I’m on the autism spectrum and my wife has ADHD. I’m a stay at home pet-parent and she works a corporate job.
  
    I always get a little upset when she sees her friend and it’s driving me nuts. I’m always happy for her to hangout with her friend and have a good time, but I instantly get jealous. Not out of a fear that she will cheat or anything, but I just get sad that I don’t have friends.
  
    I have my one best friend, but she lives 9 hours away in a different state so we never see each other. Maybe 1 time every 1-3 years. I’m okay with texts and sometimes calls, but I always prefer face-to-face interaction as it’s easier for me to communicate and understand the other person…so the distance makes things really hard.
  
    This also isn’t a situation where I’m not allowed to hang out with my wife and her friend ever, and I totally understand wanting your friend to yourself; but even when I do spend time with them I feel like I’m just a body there. They talk too fast for me to keep up and join in conversation and I always go “too deep” into things. Then it seems like no one ever knows how to respond so the conversation ends or moves on with no response to what I’ve said. Or they are talking about things I don’t/can’t have any input on. So I usually just stay quiet at this point which then makes things awkward cause they think I’m angry.
  
    So I’m just confused and frustrated. I don’t know how to NOT feel upset/jealous when she sees her friend. She is seeing her this weekend, going to her house that’s an hour and a half away. Which to top off, her friend never comes here. My wife says it’s cause she doesn’t like having people over because of our animals (2 dogs 4 cats) and people will judge or not like them and her friend doesn’t like driving. It feels selfish, but in a way I feel like that makes me feel even more shutout. She gets to go out and spend the night and I stay home and watch a movie with the animals.
  
    I’m not trying to have this sound like a pity party, I don’t want to feel this way every time she sees her friend. I just don’t know what to do or how to handle it better. I also just have a really hard time making friends. I’m always open to conversation but I feel like I end up just being the emotional support buddy or I’m just too weird.
  
    Any advice on anything I can do different or better in this situation?

    i showed up today and was immediately overwhelmed. the owner started taking me around the back and showing me stuff and then asked one of the managers to show me how everything works. in my interview, i was told i'd be starting with ticket redemption. i walked in and was told i was starting with everything. ticket redemption, security, registers, making food, stocking, cleaning, managing/creating reservations, EVERYTHING. not to mention they have panic buttons that call the police when pressed for us to take when we go outside. the fact that it's even needed was a huge red flag..
  
    owner asked all the workers to make sure i rang up every customer that came in at the register. there was only about 5 since its a weekday, but i messed up every single one and had a few upset people. that's not even including how much i struggled to count the change. i absolutely can't do mental math. i couldn't even understand what they were saying to me most of the time. i have SPD, and trying to understand someone from behind a counter while the tv, music, and arcade machines are blasting is a nightmare.
  
    i guess i'm glad my plan for quitting my first job was to just not show up, because i would've been screwed if i had told them i was quitting and then also quit this job.
  
    all this being said, if anyone has job recommendations, that'd be great. hosting is my only job experience. my highest education is high school (i did receive my diploma). i don't think cashier would be good for me because of my mental math issue. hosting is much too stressful for me and i don't communicate very well. i wanted to try being a barista, but i was told i'd have to memorize things and i have worsening short term memory issues. i wanted to do prep cook, but i can't control my hands very well. ugh. it feels like i was doomed to fail. my few skills are only useful in unrealistic careers. yeah im good at games and writing, but what am i gonna do, become a top twitch streamer or best selling author?

    My partner 23M (auDHD) and I 22F (ADHD) have been dating for nearly 2 years. I have experienced some intense relationship anxiety at points due to trauma from an abusive relationship in my past, but I'm in therapy and it's something I'm working on (and actually - its at the best point it's ever been. Really manageable at the minute!)
  
    My partner's family don't know about me. His parents were extremely emotionally abusive to him growing up, and so he doesn't really talk to them much, and when he does, he doesn't share much information with them. This is something that really used to bother me but now I wholly understand and empathise with him, and that he doesn't consider his family to be his family. All of the people in his life who he loves, know about me.
  
    However, due to some life circumstances, there's a chance he may have to move home in the next 6 months to live with his parents (we dont live togegher currently). It's 6 hours away on the train and a 5 hours drive. He's really stressed about it all at the minute, so I don't want to add to the stress by making it about the relationship, but its made me realise a dealbreaker I have: If he has to move home and does not tell his family, I simply would not be able to do it. I'm happy to try long distance, as long as I'd be able to visit him and there be communication and honesty with all parties involved. But I don't think I could and will not be a secret to them and not be able to visit him.
  
    However, I really don't know how to go about communicating it. There's an element of distrust I have in myself about the dealbreaker, due to how much relationship anxiety I normally have, and I also don't want it to come across like a manipulative ultimatum or anything. What if me communicating it makes him resentful?
  
    If he were to move out, it wouldn't be for another 3 months, so it's not like actively happening, nor is it even confirmed that he will definitley move home, so I don't want to bring it up too early or anything. Does anyone have any advice? I've never really communicated dealbreakers or anything like that before.

In my experience, women tend to be not only kinder but also more emotionally skilled than men, making it easier for me to connect with them.
  
    When it comes to friendships, I value genuine connection over mere shared interests or activities. To me, a meaningful relationship depends on both parties feeling comfortable sharing emotional experiences.
  
    Unfortunately, I haven't found this level of emotional openness as often with men. Many times I've attempted to connect with other guys, only to encounter their cold-ass shell of insecurity-driven performance. It's truly frustrating because navigating these social dynamics, such as maintaining friendships and opening up, is one of my greatest challenges in life. Each time I exert this effort, I find myself trying hard, only to feel drained and even more isolated when the other person fails to reciprocate or doesn't attempt to meet me halfway.
  
    Does anyone else relate to this experience?

I am an autistic (not diagnosed yet) adult and I am a masters student studying Clinical Psychology at Staffordshire university.

For my postgraduate research, I am seeking participants who have a formal autism diagnosis to take part in a survey looking at possible reasons for why people receive a diagnosis at different ages.

If you are autistic and have a formal diagnosis, I would be very grateful if you could take part in my research, it involves answering statements on an autism screening tool (the AQ50) and providing some information about yourself

Much of the existing research in this area focuses on male/female gender identities and I am hoping to recruit cisgender, trans and nonbinary participants to explore how gender identify may be related to age of diagnosis. I would be especially grateful if you could take part if you are trans or nonbinary (but please don’t think the participants can only be trans or nonbinary, we need cisgender people too).

If you could follow this link to take part, it should take no longer than half an hour and I would be really grateful, please message me or comment if you have any questions, and feel free to share with your friends.

You can also contact myself via this email address e011033m@student.staffs.ac.uk or my research supervisor Dr Yvonne Melia at yvonne.melia@staffs.ac.uk
