From Medical News Today:\n  \n\n    ABA therapy attempts to modify and encourage certain behaviors, particularly in autistic children. It is not a cure for ASD, but it can help individuals improve and develop an array of skills.\n  \n\n\n    This form of therapy is rooted in behaviorist theories. This assumes that reinforcement can increase or decrease the chance of a behavior happening when a similar set of circumstances occurs again in the future.\n  \n\n    From our wiki: How can I tell whether a treatment is reputable? Are there warning signs of a bad or harmful therapy?\n\n\n\n\n      Read more"

ISTG get confused about one social cue or misconstrue a single statement on accident and these assholes will treat you like you just came out of the womb.

The whole time I was talking like I normally do with my friends and in group discussions where everyone understands my ideas fine, or at least I think they do. Her saying that I wasn\u2019t making any sense when I was thoughtfully planning my answers for her really brought me back to reality that to everyone else it really does seem like I\u2019m talking in an alien language.

I thought I was doing what she wanted, I just wanted to help her not feel scared.\n  \n    Is it normal for non-autistic people to interrupt each other in a conversation? Welcomed even , like my gf said? Why did she make me out to be so dumb when I was using very clear and informed discussion?

The only one that worked for me was when I worked at the Vans store.

I\u2019m also a trans man (I guess somewhat genderqueer, I mean I use he/him pronouns and typically want to be perceived as a man, but I still hate gender haha). So I feel like I already had to dress in a way that was performative and Not Me, prior to transition. I didn\u2019t transition until I was 34.\n  \n    So it just has all these added layers of resentment for me, and I want to fight this but don\u2019t know what to say that will make sense to them. I\u2019m also not diagnosed and can\u2019t afford it. So I can\u2019t really frame it as asking for accommodations.

I know logically I shouldn\u2019t care so much, but I hate it so much that it\u2019s making me physically sick and it\u2019s making me not want to go to work tomorrow.\n  \n    Thoughts? Sorry, I know this got long. And yes I am looking for another job. :-/\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

Ill never understand why some people cant pick up a hint. I walk around stores hands in my pockets and head down or constantly gripping my jacket tails. I try and stay polite but reserved and say \"excuse me\", \"have a good day\" etc and people jsut look at me as if i said \"fuck you\" or \"i just ran over your dog\" the simple fact i exist and aint some yippity yappity howdy doodee fella is a good enuff reason to look at me as dogshit. When i got off worm today i just wanted to go get someothing fofor dinner and leave for home, got to Tim's and noticed the drive thru was under construction, almost considered just goin home. I hate entering most stores, at the moment im even more awkward than usaul because im quitting nicotine at the moment. I decided it'd probably be fine to enter the store. I got out and purposely let this old dude go ahead of me and he held open the door. I said \"thanks holmes\" and we get to the second door, and he goes \"lets try that again\" and i just assumed he didnt hear me, i have really good hearing and everything i saw sounds loud to me. I said \"thanks man\" louder when he opened the second door, we got to the counter, as hes ordering his stuff i look at the menu and he turns aroudn and asks \"what are you getting\" and i immediately think to our small town trend of \"buy the person behind you's order\" and i jumped to \"no man you dont gotta buy my food or nothing, thanks tho\" and he goes \"i was jusg askin j dont wanna buy your stuff\" i felt like a jackass but i didnt want soemone to buy my meal because its so fucking awkward and i dont wanna sit there as the waitress goes \"what a gracious man arent you a lucky boy\". The waitress also happened to be a chick who used to hang around my group but after that the whole store looked at me like i was dogshit. I felt like just fuckin crying. Not even to be a bitch just because i was so sick of these people who try to force a conversation outta me and all thw times ive given obvious signs that i just want to be left alone. I have friends i talk to, it doesnt bring me happiness to talk to a stranger. I appreciate them but please just lay off when im giving obvious signs i just want to exist quietly. I know it isnt the worst thing to have autism but it doesnt help when people simply dont want to respect the fact unless your loud and in their face about it\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

Nowadays i just contain myself a lot around other people, I avoid (for example) some comments, not because I think they\u2019re impolite, but because I don\u2019t want to risk being viewed as impolite, as a result of it all. It\u2019s not like \u201cmasking\u201d(I think), it\u2019s just not getting too intense about anything around people.\n  \n    All of this makes me indecisive, when I don\u2019t want to socialise with people, for as rude as it is, a part of me will say \u201cit\u2019s just your autism, it\u2019s totally valid if you don\u2019t wanna interact\u201d, and another part, like an inner voice of my parents, says \u201cit\u2019s rude to not interact, simple as, you should feel bad for not doing so\u201d.

Straight As, lots of extracurriculars, extremely high SAT score, top tier college, prestigious job out of undergrad. I'm now early-40s and have had a wildly successful career by most standards, financially above all else. I ended up making it to the senior exec level in big tech with a couple large windfalls in recent years.\n  \n    All along, I've felt like I was hanging on by a thread. I only recently learned that I'm ADHD and autistic, though the signs were there all along. Lots of sensory issues as a child. Always felt like an unknowable outsider. Constant struggles to click with others socially. Intense interests and pursuits. Alcohol as a crutch to connect with others.\n  \n    Professionally, for decades I have described my experience to others as \"arming up\" with my \"work mask\" every working day. My work self was outgoing, friendly and driven which felt like the uniform I was supposed to wear to be successful. I was low-level miserable more often than not and would often feel like I'd be holding my breath for 2 or 3 years in a given job until I could \"escape\" to the next one. My motivation was almost exclusively achievement and financial reward; the work itself rarely felt purposeful or engaging.\n  \n    I used medication to deal with serious public speaking anxiety. Lots of imposter syndrome. Receiving constructive feedback and having performance reviews was excruciating. I was constantly told I was incredibly smart and at times I'd feel highly competent, confident, and effective. Other times I'd feel like a fraud that lucked into my circumstances.\n  \n    Having discovered I'm AuDHD, I've been able to extend compassion and grace to myself for both my personal and professional challenges. I'm now trying to figure out what my career should look like going forward. There's a part of me that wants to just throw in the towel given that I've had success but have had a generally negative experience.\n  \n    On the other hand, I'd love to figure out a way to reshape my work pursuits to be truly meaningful and engaging.

        "body": "I was subjected to unethical medical experimentation as a child for this very purpose (lol didn't work), so every so often I end up thinking about the concept of \"a cure\" and the various points of view that people have on it (both within and outside of our community). I've seen plenty of neurotypical people talk about \"the need for a cure\" (ugh, haven't we all?), but I've also seen other autistic people talk about it, too - people on all sides of the spectrum saying \"well, if I could have a cure, I would\". As a kid, I was one of those people. I fully believed my family's rhetoric around autism being The Thing That Was Wrong With Me and if they could just fix it, I'd always be happy, right?\n  \n    I think I finally figured out what bothers me about the entire concept (outside of the obvious lol): it's not about the cure, it's about the relief. I would never, ever want to \"cure\" my autism. It's how my brain developed, it's an integral part of my personality and interests, my skills and challenges. There are plenty of deeply autistic things about me that are inconvenient or harmful in some way - sometimes struggling with sensory stuff or \"coming on too strong\" socially - and yeah, some of that stuff I would love to be able to control! It would be cool if there was a medication I could take that would make certain types of light or noise bearable on a bad day, like taking a painkiller for a headache. I'd love it if there was an actual form of positive, constructive talk therapy that could genuinely teach me some of the social awareness that I still struggle with at times. But neither of those would change who I am, they would just relieve some of the discomfort. There always seems to be an element of removing our agency and changing us completely when people advocate for \"the cure\", even among autistic people. The only \"fix\" I could ever want would be the exact opposite - relief for some of the challenges that I could pick and choose, not the other way around. People always talk about \"the cure\" (from medical intervention or, god fucking forbid, ABA) as if it's some kind of universal thing that would just make us neurotypical, but that's such bullshit. I'd love to get relief from some of the things I struggle with most and keep my weird social intuition and special interest in air traffic control, lmao. I can only imagine how much better my life would have been if, instead of trying to effectively put me through conversion therapy, my parents had been able to hand me the equivalent of paracetamol when I was struggling and say \"hey, take this and your body will stop hating the sound of your own heartbeat!\"\n  \n    Of course, there's the obvious answer - making the world an easier place for us to live in without ever having to change or adapt - but I see people say really intelligent things about that quite often, so I thought I'd look at this angle instead. :) Sorry for the ramble! (Much like the rest of us, I come by it honestly :P) I hope any of this makes sense. Would love to hear anyone else's thoughts as they have them!\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

        "body": "So I saw this tiktok where it was like ppl with autism often experience empathy in a different way. Like we literally try to put ourselves in another persons shoes and I fully agree as that was honestly the only way I could try and feel empathy for others. And looking back on it and even now I completely agree that that is how I experience empathy. Any time I try and comfort someone I always preface that while I feel sympathy for them I don\u2019t understand how they feel so my advise may not work. Cause at the end of the day we are all different ppl. I am not going to go super into it but the person who talked about it on tiktok is @genericartdad if you want to check him out. But then I realized that I honestly went a lot further than just that.\n  \n    So my friends always joke with me that I have an addiction to angst and that all my fav character are angsty and yah it\u2019s true. But this was early covid times like right before covid started where I became really hyper fixated on this one character and this character could not catch a break. Like they honestly just suffered and suffered and suffered. And i adored the character. Like I cried every night because of him. But I always felt horrible because even though I knew he was fake I constantly lived with the guilt that my life was so much better than his and that I could never really, truly understand his suffering. And it started to really bother me, i could not physically handle it. To the point I got sick and threw up a few times at the thought. So what I did? I started self harming in hopes to make myself suffer like him. And I know that\u2019s crazy but I could not handle the thought of him suffering alone. And I am a lot better now I have gone to therapy and learned to cope in a better way but I need to know if this is something other autistic ppl experienced? Thanks yall :)\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

I was diagnosed with ocd at 14 but autism didn't come until later. I know some symptoms overlap.. I'm 29 now  I don't think autism was the right diagnosis I think schizophrenia is probably a better diagnosis again I'm not an expert. I have a lot of things that align with autism, it's hard for me to relate to people, emotions don't make sense, I stim when I'm stressed but maybe that could be both?\n  \n    I don't hear voices. But sometimes people talk about me. I'm not a very likeable person I know that but sometimes coworkers will get together and while I don't here exactly what they say I sometimes catch my name when I over hear snips of what they say.. I know that people I'm \"friends\" with don't like me.  They never talk to me unless I'm there but they all know things I only tell one or two of them. I mean fuck my closest friend hasn't even texted me in 5 months but a different friend knows about an issue I told my closest friend about???\n  \n    I am inexplicably paranoid at times. I cant do anything at home that is loud because iight not hear someone break in. If I'm outside and someone drives by I have to hide.. I don't want to I have to\n  \n    I know paranoia can be a symptom of autism. I know almost all of my symptoms could be explained as autism. But some it doesn't really fit. I know symptoms can overlap and I don't know why I need a lable but I know I'm not normal and I think I'm going crazy which means I'm not cause crazy people don't know they're crazy but it just makes more sense but whenever I ask for help they just say \"yeah your autistic weird things happen\" which yes maybe they do I'm not trying to belittle anyone else's problem but I don't know where else to ask because no one gives a singular fuck or they just say it's cause of the autism. I've done online tests for both schizophrenia and autism and I score really high for both. I know it's not necessarily accurate but on a schizophrenia test I scored 58 out of 60 with 25 being a score of seek professional help. Every other test out me I similar ranges.. But I also scored high on several autism tests too. Maybe it's in my head. It probably is everything else is anyway. It's not fair. I want it to end. I don't care what's wrong with me. I want to be able to fix it or die. None of my doctors care it's only autism, I have no friends, my parents constantly tellme I'm a worthless asshole.

Check out this Github repo for download and installation instructions.\n\n    Hi, for my data science bachelor\u2019s thesis I\u2019ve been developing a browser extension with a new approach to fight distractions. Instead of specifying apps or keywords to match, you briefly write down your task, what you need for it and what usually distracts you. Then, tab and program titles are continously evaluated for how distracting they are in regard to this description - completely offline on your device, nobody is monitoring you. The extension is designed to be neurodiversity-friendly, particularly in regards to ADHD, autism and demand avoidance. If you get distracted, one of 3 interventions will be triggered automatically:\n  \n\n\n    a chatbot to help you get back on track\n  \n\n\n    all distracting tabs are automatically identified and you\u2019ll be offered to close or save them for later\n  \n\n\n    Firefox only: nudging you by coloring the toolbar depending on your distraction level\n  \n\n\n    Additionally, you can check out your score history in a dashboard. Here are some potential use cases for this approach:\n  \n\n\n    you need to browse some distracting website for a task, but also procrastinate there\n  \n\n\n    you find yourself overwhelmed with dozens of tabs open and want to sort out all the distracting ones with one click\n  \n\n\n    you are stuck in a hole of executive dysfunction or autistic inertia and need a push to get out of it\n  \n\n\n    you\u2019ve been using nudging tools but got annoyed about staring at a green screen for 10 seconds when you just need to take a quick look somewhere\n  \n\n\n    you\u2019ve tried other blocking tools but found yourself sabotaging them out of frustration about rules being incompatible with reality\n  \n\n\n    I\u2019m looking for volunteers to test this extension. If you complete the full study (12 days for Firefox / 9 days for other browsers), you\u2019ll be eligible to participate in a raffle in which two winners will receive 20\u20ac each. All you have to do is occasionally interacting with short self report prompts and the interventions. Every 3 days, the type of intervention that is triggered (of the ones listed above) changes, finished by a baseline period. Some very limited data will be transmitted back to me for research during the study, see the Privacy section in the Github repo for details.\n  \n    Thanks for reading this far, and let me know if you have any other questions or feedback.\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

After all, I was tested when I was younger and it did not show I was. At a young age, I always knew I was different, much different than others. I remember extremely vividly that I autism was a very strong possibility for me, even at a young age. But when I saw Autism back then, it was mostly considered non-verbal, low functioning, etc.... not the way we currently understand it today.\n  \n    As such, I effectively gaslit myself, slowly without realizing - similar to the allegory of the frog and the hot water. I had to learn to communicate and deal with people who were neurotypical while no one understood me, not even my parents. I begged for years for my parents to explain to me but they misunderstood me. One prime example was every year, I would get a report card and it would say OP is very inquisitive and every year I would ask my parents what it means. They would say \"it means you ask too many questions\" and just laugh. I got mad because they weren't explaining it, just laughing to me. It was one day when I came across the definition randomly did it all make sense. I know to some of you this seems silly but that was a huge moment for me. I'm speak literally.\n  \n    When I first got diagnosed, I felt a medley of emotions. I feel very bad that I missed \"being autistic\" during my life. I lead a life of a typical person, as best as I could (think of those funny IG/Tiktok posts of an animal blending in with another). I felt a bit of resentment but when I examined the situation more clearly, it was a blessing in disguise because if I was more of a typical autistic during my childhood and young adult life, I realistically would not be alive today for various reasons. I also have an extremely keen insight onto the way other neurotypical (and now autistic) individuals which puts me into a position of power in certain situations (Ex: Negotiations/bargaining, discussions, etc...).\n  \n    Anyone else care to share their story? I know a lot of people on reddit are autistic or have some part of themselves on the spectrum. Any advice? Any successes or failures of your own?\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

So this year I decided to sing one of my favorite songs as a solo. This song is called \u201cThe Ballad of Jane Doe\u201d from a musical called Ride the Cyclone. The song is very high pitched and a bit difficult but I decided to sing it because I hate being underestimated (especially in singing because I am self taught).

Unfortunately, due to my reputation for being weird, a very small amount of people actually complimented me (my school is EXTREMELY small) but I had a friend who paid attention to other\u2019s reactions to tell me later.

But either way...\n  \n    You may not fit into one specific category. For example, for me, as far back as I can remember, I was obsessed with anything creative. From the time I could hold a pencil or paint brush... Drawing, painting, sculpting, carving... anything I could get my hands on. But I was also taking things apart to see how they worked - Radios, computers, cell phones, remote control cars, etc. I like to create and invent things that are both beautiful and functional. I also love writing and literature.

        "body": "Hey there, I'm a proud dad to my 3 year old son with the tism! He is high functioning, I'd say level 1, a genius-to-be, semi-verbal with current inability to communicate verbally. He only echoes, but the amount of things he echoes is crazy, sometimes being entire 20 minute episodes of Elmo. Anywho, he is very independent, as long as things are in his reach, he can go hours without anyone at his side. He plays alone, never seeks praise, just is in his own little world (big world in his head, I think. I imagine in his head he sees so many shapes, letters, colors, numbers, nursery rhymes, animals, dinosaurs, etc, I feel like it's likely nonstop as he literally NEVER stops \"talking\"). As for myself, I'm a nurse dad. I make a great living. I'm very proud of my son, and I don't hide his ASD from anyone #noshame. I'm a go-getter, I love challenges and am very headstrong, quitting is never even close to option for me. I'm burdened by being a perfectionist, and I'm also burdened by being a \"fixer\" due to my personality. I'm extremely competitive, I take on leadership roles naturally, am very calm, leveled, calculated during high stress situations (such as people dying, dangerous environments, etc). All of this to say, I'm admittedly stubborn at times, but also open-minded and considerate as well. Overall, I pride myself on being a family man that can do anything I put my mind to and will do anything I have to do no matter the difficulty for the ones I love, including my son. Now you know a little about me so as to have a go with my issue. Now, the dilemma. Medicaid. Them calling my son disabled if I apply for it. My wife has had the moms on her pages tell her Medicaid helps with ASD and getting things done in regards to therapies and what not. I applied for it, and in doing so, had to choose the \"disabled child in home\", as we're over income for the rest of them, including SSI. Again, I don't want SSI or a check written to me. I want what's best for my son. We have United Healthcare through my job, but I've heard that Medicaid is better when it comes to ABA and other therapies. Plus having him declared disabled opens avenues through the state. But I'm not entirely ok with having him called disabled by the government. I don't see him as disabled. He has some shortcomings, as do we all. I plan to help him past them, as I would my NT child. Also, the government requires full access to his medical record. I'm not ok with that either. That's MY son's privacy, not Uncle Sam's. His diagnosis should be enough, not his entire medical record and ongoing. It's like for the government to help for something they likely caused (don't get me down that rabbit hole), I have to sign over custody to them AND have them title my child as disabled. Of course, I understand that disability is a broad term covering physical, mental, intellectual, etc, but in my mind he is none of those. He's a toddler that has quirks and has complications that are resolvable or atleast adaptable. And he's only 3, for all I know, some or most of this will change for the better as he gets older and smarter. Some will say, \"just get over it, they can call him something but that doesn't mean he is, just ignore it to get what he needs, you said you'd do anything for his betterment\". Yes. But again, I'm confrontational when it comes to injustices and things that aren't right. I can't just sit by and allow a wrong to happen, even if it's \"for the better good\". I'm the guy that tries to find the alternative route to the better good without the wrong being an option. Idk, as you can see, it's created quite the internal dilemma in me. I want my son to have Medicaid if it will help him, but I also don't want him to be called something that he's not, and I also don't want his privacy invaded, as it's MY job to protect that for him as his father. I think I even feel as though having him declared disabled is declaring defeat, submitting to autism, failing him as a parent, like I'm giving up, conceding my child's well-being to the government. But then again maybe it's not permanent, just a temporary declaration to better arm us for the road to helping him adapt to this world. I'm heavily conflicted on it the more I think about it. Perhaps you think it's stupid, you wouldn't worry about it. Maybe it is. It's not affecting me negatively, I'm not depressed or bummed out. It's just on my mind, especially when I look at the Medicaid packet they sent for me to fill out. My mind went to storming about it while I hesitatingly browsed through the packet. Red flags were shooting around my brain telling me I should burn it, buckle up and find a different way without the gov holding my hand. But what a little assistance going to hurt? It's not admitting failure, but more so just getting some help. But I don't need help at that cost that I'm hung on. Mental war. Have any dads or even moms felt this way before? Any relations to my venting? Perhaps no one understands what I'm feeling here. I'm admittedly an odd cookie, but a prideful, determined, steadfast one at that, a protective papa bear! Thanks for reading this far. Anywho, keep up the great work moms, dads, brothers, sisters, fam, therapists, friends, and you all with ASD. I love you all, and I'm proud of everyone for pushing through everyday. Little victories and major victories, they're all wins. We just have to do better tomorrow than we did today. I'm sure trying. Just keep being awesome\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0e I'll probably just put my pride aside and do the app because it's what my wife wants and I want to ease her worries and mind, and it's likely what's best for him in the long run. Still doesn't help how I feel inside about it. It's just my personality and unfortunately at times like these, how my mind works. Thanks again! Have a great Friday-Eve\ud83d\ude2c\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

You do not need to currently have access to respite care to participate, a diversity of experiences and voices are welcome and appreciated.\n  \n    Hello parents and caregivers,\n  \n    My name is Valerie Senkowski, and I am a PhD student in the department of Educational Leadership at\u00a0Miami\u00a0University. I am conducting a study for my dissertation research on parents' use of respite care for children on the autism spectrum. I would greatly appreciate it if you would assist me by participating in this research study. This survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. All of your responses will be anonymous. Completion of the survey is voluntary. You must be above the age of 18 and a parent or legal guardian of a child ages 2-18 with an autism diagnosis in the United States to participate.\n  \n    The possible risks or discomforts of the study are minimal, although you may feel some stress or anxiety answering some of the questions about private matters. For every survey completed, a $1 donation will be made to support Pause for Parents, Play for Kids, a nonprofit organization which serves special needs children and their families.\u00a0\n  \n    If you have any questions about the study, you can contact me at\u00a0senkowvm@miamioh.edu, or my faculty advisor Dr. Paul Branscum\u00a0branscpw@miamioh.edu.\n  \n    Thank you for your time.

Now we only talk during weekends, but I expect that to change for the better for a period of time during the summer.

The problem is that whenever they're frustrated for something which I'm able to do pretty easily, they tell me to shut up.

        "body": "Hello. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. I'm a 26(f) autistic adult with a learning disability and I was wondering if other autistic people go through phases where they fidget or stim more? Idk why it's freaking me out...I've always been fidgety. Always have had to do things with my hands but recently it's gotten a lot \"worse\". I can't sit still anymore. Sitting through lectures used to be fine, I used to be able to put through videos just fine. I have been dealing with mental health struggles like burnout. I'm on medication for depression and in therapy. I plan on bringing this up to my therapist. I have actually been feeling a bit better recently since my medication has taken effect and I been trying to priorize my mental health. So if I'm getting better, why is my stimming so much worse?? Even just trying to do homework or draw I'll start fidgeting with my hands, intense rocking, etc. I've had moments where I could not sit still and would stand up and pace around, flapping, fidgeting and disturbingly I'll start hitting myself. Not hard, I resist those impulses. But I'll hit my thighs and hips, idk why. It's like my limbs just need to MOVE. Sorry it's so long, it's just been on my mind. Especially since it's starting to get physical. Has anyone had this happen? Am I going crazy?? Autism doesn't get worse right?? What's going on?? Am I just stressed?\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

I worked 36 hours at my previous job, but I quit a half year after my diagnosis because I couldn't handle it anymore. Not only because of work and my bosses, but also because 36 hours was way too much for me to handle AND also do my chores at home.I live alone, have 2 cats since december 2023. I have autism coaching since 3 months to keep me regulated, but I still struggle a LOT with cleaning my house and the chores in overall.. How do you guys do it?I have a whiteboard in my kitchen with a weekplanning, all with magnet plates in different colors you can write on. Also have a smaller board that says TO DO and has the main chores (dishes/throwing away garbage/laundry/dying the dishes etc etc) with a \"done\" and \"not done\" switch. Which is helping sometimes for the main chores, but I still feel like my house is a fucking mess and it gets me so overwhelmed. I come home from work, cook myself dinner and after that my energy is just gone. My mom and my coach tell me to \"do it later when I have the energy\" but I only have Thursdays and Sundays off and it feels like I have to clean both whole days to get ANYTHING done and just wasted all of my spare time to relax and take it easy (which is already a difficult task for us autistic people).\n  \n    Any more people with the same trouble? Or have some tips? I suspect I have adhd as well (which was the main reason to get me tested, but only got autism lol). I tend to have \"piles\" of stuff laying everywhere in my home and I exactly know where everything is. But if I would have a \"cleaning frenzy\", it would cause me to have panic afterwards because I can't find anything anymore and its frustrating haha. Also; I don't know where to begin or in what tempo I should do everything. It feels like its 0% or 100% and nothing in between :(\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

        "body": "false\n      \n\n    First of all, I know how fucked up this was, I can't stop thinking about how horrible of a person I am for this.\n  \n    Earlier today I had a meeting with a psychiatrist that didn't go well and I got very triggered. I managed to stay calm though the meeting, but once I got out and my care worker was booking a follow-up I just couldn't take it anymore. I left the building, with intentions of waiting outside for her. I was fiddling with plants because idk I was bored and my worker comes out and starts calling my name.\n  \n    I don't know what was going on in my head at this point, but I went full on meltdown and started speed walking away from her down the street. She followed me and kept asking me to stop and talk to her and where I was going. I was nonverbal at this point and juts kept going. I have no clue where I was going I just wanted her to go away.\n  \n    I got to a main road where my worker caught up to me and was right beside me now. I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I started walking trough traffic trying to get hit. I have struggled with suicidal ideation/suicide attempts in the past, but I don't think that's what this was. I didn't want to die, I don't know why I was trying to get hit.\n  \n    I walked in the road for 3 blocks while my worker called 911 because I wasn't getting out of the road. It was pouring rain and I got soaked and was freezing. The ambulance came first and directed traffic away from me. I kept walking until I was by my old highschool (transfered to a different one 2 years ago). There was a class going on a walk that saw me in the road with an ambulance following.\n  \n    Eventually the cops arrived too and drove their cars in front of me to cut me off. I just bolted and they grabbed me. I got apprehended under the mental health act and taken to the hospital for a little while before being released.\n  \n    All I can think about is how I scared the shit out of not only my worker, but a bunch of innocent people just trying to drive to work or pick up their kids or get groceries or something. Those people didn't deserve to have to dodge a mental headcase of a teen walking through the road. That class of teens, some of which may even have recognized me, didn't deserve to see another kid getting handcuffed and taken into an ambulance. These people were just trying to live a normal day and had the misfortune of witnessing my bullshit. I can't stop thinking of the trauma I probably inflicted on them and how much of a shit person I am for doing that. I don't even know why I did it too...\n  \n    Its not even the first time I've inflicted genuine trauma on people because of my struggles, my poor foster family had to deal with me for years with incidents MUCH worse than this one. I've cause so many people so much pain with my meltdowns and I genuinely and wholeheartedly believe that I am an abuser. I don't want to be, I don't try to be, in fact I do everything I can to avoid these urges and triggers to not act like this, but I can't change the fact that I hurt people. I traumatize people. I'm a fucking abuser.\n  \n    I keep searching google for stuff like \"girl running through traffic in my city\" or \"girl walking in road I was on\", scanning the news to see if anyone has mentioned my incident or posted about it on social media. I feel so horrible for my actions. I've barely eaten today or done anything but mindlessly scroll, I feel like I don't deserve to eat or do anything.\n  \n    I know I wasn't thinking straight, but I don't think that excuses it. Especially because I have faced absolutely no repercussions outside of being taken to the hospital for a few hours, but I was immediately released and sent home. My worker and the manager of the group home I live in literally said to me that I'm not in trouble and they're going to make sure I don't get punished for this, but I feel like I deserve punishment. I acted horribly, why is everyone acting like its fine? I hurt so many innocent bystanders today for nothing!!\n  \n    Idk I'm sorry, I needed to get this off my chest. Feel free to berate me in the comments, I know how fucked up I am for this.\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

In every job I've had, I've enjoyed the work but left due to a micromanagey coworker.  I generally get along with almost everyone, but it just takes that one who will inevitably pop up to take it from a job I love to one where I'm drinking myself to sleep every night until I ultimately quit.\n  \n    They always have the manager wrapped around their finger.  At my last job, the manager was occasionally a bit of a problem as well, but it's generally coworkers.  That manager was weird: she'd be very hand-off but occasionally decide to breathe down my neck, usually when I voiced concerns about anything (which led to me no longer communicating, which led to her getting onto me for not communicating).\n  \n    Do I just have to continue this cycle of dealing with a job for as long as I can before changing to find a new micromanager to deal with?  Or is there some solution?  Maybe a job with few coworkers?\n  \n    Ultimately, I plan to work alone (I'm a counseling major finishing up grad school and plan to start my own practice), but that will take at least 5 years to get licensed and enough experience, capital to rent a place, etc.\n  \n    And I'm not sure what to do in the meantime: this is exhausting, and now I'm to the point where I'm paralyzed trying to find a new job.  I've been unemployed for months, and I'm burning through my savings.  But I'm so afraid of choosing wrong and dealing with this again.\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

        "body": "I'm female and currently in highschool and about 98% sure that I am autistic. I've spent years researching asd and ADHD, and I just can't imagine a world in which someone would get to know me and insist that I'm neurotypical.\n  \n    I've discussed the possibility of me being autistic before with my mom, and she insists there's nothing \"wrong\" with me and that I'm just lazy or weird or a normal teenager. She seems to be slightly more accepting of the idea recently, but is still definitely of the mindset that a label would just ruin my future and cause people to discriminate against me. While this is a valid point for many people, I believe the benefits that accomodations in school would have on my mental health would far outweigh any possible downsides of this \"label\". At least in the present. I'm wondering if I should push more on talking to a doctor about it.\n  \n    After I first bought this up to my mom a couple of years ago, she very casually mentioned how she used to think that I had Asperger's (which is of course now recognized as a part of ASD) when I was little, but I \"grew out of that\". I really don't understand it.\n  \n    I have already been \"assessed\" (I put in quotes because it was a done by my general pediatrician using only fill in the bubble surveys from me, me parents, and a teacher)in 8th grade for ADHD, but was told I don't have it. I think this may be because I made the mistake of giving the form to the teacher who had known me the longest, assuming she would have the best insight on me. I only later found out that she didn't believe that girls could have ADHD after talking to a friend who has had a formal diagnosis since second grade, but this teacher pretended it didn't exist. I went to a private school pre k through 8th grade so they didn't care much about it. That teacher was the reason that friend switched to homeschooling.\n  \n    I excelled in school until around 5th grade, which is when I began to struggle to keep up with homework and time management, especially in subjects I didn't much like. I think a lot of my symptoms probably flew under the radar at my old school because it was small a comfortable and familiar environment, surrounded by many of the same people for years at a time, along with being in small classes of 14 or less people. I was just me there, and everyone knew me as kinda weird but also they were used to it. The transition from an 8th grade class of 9 people to an overpopulated public highschool with almost 3,000 students was incredibly difficult, and these last two years I have never struggled more in school. My mental health has been such a rollercoaster and I'm so stressed out. I think I'd benefit greatly from a 504 plan.\n  \n    Sorry for the obscenely long post, and thank you to anyone who read through everything. I'd be really grateful for any advice on the matter.\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

        "body": "Im not diagnosed and im not trying to diagnose myself but i simply wanted to ask some people who are more knowledgeable about this topic.\n  \n    Im a girl and here are some of the things i observed about myself that made me questions this:\n  \n\n\n    when i was little ( 6 -11)  i would shake my hands without even knowing i was doing it.  I would do it in school and  at home especially when i was stressed or just thinking and day dreaming. To this day i do it sometimes when im alone ( when i was a kid my mum got angry at me for it) because it helps me be more calm.\n  \n\n\n    i would do wierd movements when sitting down or walking when alone ( when i was a kid i would do them whenever ) especially when im day dreaming ( i day dream most of my day) or when im imagining something. This also happens on its own and i don\u2019t  know im doing it\n  \n\n\n    -when i was a kid i was extremely scared and irritate by loud sounds. I remember i was extremely scared of fireworks. Once we were having family over and all the kids were outside looking at the fireworks but i had to be with my mum inside the house as i wouldn\u2019t stop crying. For my 11th birthday my dad was doing fireworks and i stood outside the house with my mum, really far away. I ended up begging her for us to go inside the car as it wouldn\u2019t  be as loud. She would get angry at me for not acting \u201cnormal\u201d.\n  \n    I was also scared of balloons poping becouse of how loud the sound is when that happens.  I would still play with them but whenever someone was making one or i saw a balloon that seemed close to poping i would cover my ears and often start crying. I remember for one of my birthdays when i was really young my dad was blowing a balloon and before he even started i asked him not to overdo it so it wouldn\u2019t pop. He started to overdo it and i was thinking it was going to pop so i covered my ears and stared crying. I never seen someone as a kid be so anxious about things like that.\n  \n    -i seem to behave a bit differently to other people. I behave a bit more monotone then others even when i don\u2019t mean to. For example, when i get given a gift and i am very  happy about it  i have to force myself to seem happy and most of the time it doesn\u2019t  really work out so people think im not happy with it or disappointed. Throughout my whole life i was told i always look very sad and my family keeps asking me if im okey. This happens when i feel fine?\n  \n    -im often anxious about many things especially when im in public. I start to think i walk weird and that people are looking at me. This causes me to act very weird and ackwardly as if im moving too fast and cant focus on things like people around me who just seem calm. I heard of people talking about being over-stimulated often in public.\n  \n    I was hoping i could get given some simple advice or input ( because maybe im just being stupid )but actually seeing if i can diagnose is out of question as my mum would simply laugh in my face if i ever tried to bring any of this up.\n  \n    (Sry for any spelling mistakes im writing this on my phone)\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

She sees no use and benefit in possibly having it diagnosed, because \"it would just be another lable I don't need\" She does think my brother (also diagnosed with ADHD but around 5 or 6.

There are some symptoms or some behavior I have that would fit with the description. I know that online tests don't give accurate or true results, but I still tried a few and they confirmed what I was already thinking. Again I know that just because an online test said I might be autistic doesn't actually make it true so I'm planning on talking to a professional soon.\n  \n    But I feel like I'm trying to shove myself into something I'm not a part of. Like all of my symptoms and behavior can be explained through other means and I'm trying to make myself a victim somehow. I'm scared I'm just making all of it up just to get sympathy or something. Even though I know I would never do that on purpose, I struggle with my emotions and often don't know the exact reason behind them and I don't know if this time it's the same, where I think I'm just trying to find out the truth, but in reality I'm just trying to get pitied or something.\n  \n    So I just wanted to ask if you have any advice?

        "body": "insert butterfly meme here\n\n    Alright, I've been reading a lot of articles and posts about skill regression but I've got to ask because if I don't I'm just going to sit here and waste time obsessing over it.\n  \n    So I (26) recently realized that I've got autism and I'm currently going through assessments with my therapist. Shortly after all this started, I started noticing that I felt like I couldn't do a lot of like... really \"\"normal\"\" things. And when I would inevitably be getting really upset about the situation, I kept having the recurring thought of \"Didn't I used to be able to do this???\" Which has led me to this question.\n  \n    For example, I used to cook quite a bit and while I usually followed recipes, I had a good enough grasp on cooking that I could usually just figure stuff out and make it work but now it feels like if someone asks me to make something that seems pretty straightforward but they don't give me really clear instructions on how they want it done, it suddenly feels like I'm losing my mind and it's some insurmountable task. I also used to be good (not great or anything but not awful) about keeping up with small cleanliness and tidying tasks around the house but now it feels like I never notice when things need to be done until someone points them out, which pisses my partner off to no end which in turn becomes a huge thing because like... yeah she's right why is it so hard for me to keep things tidy? Especially when it didn't used to be? There's other little things like my coworkers commenting on how my expression when reacting to things hasnt lined up with the \"expected\" reaction (like my facial expressions have just been off when I'm trying to express certain things and so everyone's confused by what I'm trying to say, etc.\n  \n    The other big thing is that I can't handle social interactions anymore. I work in a coffee shop and have had years of being annoyed by customers but moving on where as now if the slightest thing goes wrong in the interaction (especially if I feel like the trajectory of the conversation is obvious and the customer says something unexpected/\"off topic\"/useless), I'm just done. Like it feels so extreme but there's no coming back from that in an interaction I'm just like dead faced, how do we end this as fast as possible. Which I used to be able to smile through it or just laugh it off but now it's so freaking exhausting to me. (Can't wait for the answer to be no this isn't skill regression you're just bad at your job \ud83d\ude02). But even in interactions with friends there's moments where I'll basically just try to straight up leave the interaction because something is bothering me and I'm like \"Oh you know an easy way to not be bothered? Just leave.\" People don't seem... to really appreciate that one though... and just standing up and leaving during a conversation was definitely not something I would have even thought to do before.\n  \n    Oh cool, I sound like a huge asshole now that I've written all this out \ud83d\ude02 well... I guess my question still stands of \"does any of this sound like skill regression\" or am I just the asshole?\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

        "body": "Hello all,\n  \n    The recent trains discussions have gotten me thinking about how the overall community deals with work and special interests. Idk about all of you, but there have definitely been times I'm grateful to be as independently functional as I am but I've had some moments where I would have understood if I was deemed incompetent to the point of needing full time care. This conversation isn't about that, but rather about the struggles we face enmeshing in a neurotypical environment. The book \"Look Me In The Eye\", was the first time I knew it was possible for us autistic folk to carve a niche I'm society, and still it seemed unobtainable.\n  \n    For instance I struggled working in kitchens for years because of the constant noise, and most customers facing jobs were just too peopley to not completely overwhelm me. It wasn't until I started working in private security that I was able to thrive in a work environment, but that was just because of very clear rules and plenty of alone time. It wasn't fulfilling work but it more than paid the bills.\n  \n    In recent years though I've been transitioning to working more in my special interest, bonsai, and the stresses of work have just disappeared. The days of endless anxiety, and going mute are behind me and I get to sperg out all I want to. My partner is no longer annoyed talking in circles about the special interest because.. I get it all out during the day? Plus the social component is much easier to manage with small groups. Across the board my QoL has gone up since the transition.\n  \n    Sorry for rambling, but I hope by sharing we can get the ball rolling on some convo. Have you had luck finding work that aligns with your special interest? Are you unsure what a job would even look like? Have a plan to try it? I think it'd be cool to try and build each other up here if you'd like to share, whether it's a story of success, failure, or what could be.\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

Do you still feel the pain of rejection but find it disappears quickly and you don't ruminate as much?\n  \n    I'm curious if the apprehension about approaching people will lessen after enough experiences of rejection that don't result in the usual pain thanks to the medication.\n  \n    Feel free to downvote or criticise me\u2014I want to test my response.\n  \n    Thanks!\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

I didn't struggle socially (in the sense that I was content with being alone, having 1 friend, and didn't understand when I was being picked on). I guess my only clear symptoms were a lot of anxiety, and temper tantrums. When I was 14 and started High School, I fell into a depressive episode that lasted 1 year, and after that something kindof changed. I didn't perform as well in school, and I started showing a lot of ADHD/autism symptoms. When I graduated high school I started a very relaxed art course, and living at home with my parents with barely any pressure, I decided to finally try for an ADHD/austidm diagnosis. My parents were required to give a testimony, and they stated nothing was wrong with me as a kid, except for some anxiety. This coupled with the fact that I wasn't struggling very much in daily life due to my parents caring for me, and the art course requiring very little of me, I didn't get the diagnosis due to lack of \"evidence in childhood\" and \"evidence of disability in daily life\". Fast forward and I am now my first year into college and moved out. And I am struggling. Bad. I can't take care of myself or my household properly, I am skipping entire courses, generally fatigued and I can barely engage in my hobbies anymore. I'm just sad. My lack of focus and my inability to have any kind of routine is killing me. I went to my doctor, and I have been placed in a priority queue to have another go at an adhd/autism screening. And they are going to require speaking to a family member. Seeing as my parents sortof failed me last time, as well as them moving to germany, I am considering asking my sister to vouch for me instead, as she is a bit more understanding with mental health stuff. Though I have been feeling major impostor syndrome, that I am not \"sick\" enough, and that by using my sister instead of my parents I'd be manipulating the system or something. Idk. I just really want help. Any kind words or advice is appreciated!\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"

I usually classify it as an obsession/hyperfixation at first, but if it continues at the same intensity over 6+ months, it becomes a special interest. As I've got older, my old special interests have persisted as 'normal' interests after the period of it being my main special interest has ended (e.g. My Little Pony and Steven Universe fall into these categories - I could still tell you ALL the trivia about them, and I still love both series, but I don't feel the same excitement when I think about them because my mind is preoccupied with my current main interest)\n  \n    My main interest for the last year and a half has been the TV series 'Inside no. 9', and in extension it's predecessor 'The League of Gentlemen'. I've watched every episode of both series several times over, consumed all the trivia, bought merch, etc, and I'm still absolutely in love with both series. The fanbase has introduced me to other series I have enjoyed as well. Hell, I recently got to indulge in my interest in British Comedy for a University project, and got a grade 80 for my work (equivalent to a grade A). With the final series of Inside no. 9 airing at the moment, having a comfortably sized fanbase, endless rewatchability, and a talented editing/art scene, I'm certainly NOT ready to leave this interest yet, especially when compared to what's threatening to replace it.\n  \n    When I feel a new interest beginning to take form, I can kind of feel it in my chest. Best to describe it as 'butterflies'. In the past, I've even mistook it for a panic attack, with how intense it can get. The issue is, I've been beginning to get this recently for a series I do NOT want to become fixated on - namely South Park.\n  \n    A friend encouraged me to watch some episodes of South Park recently. From a surface perspective, it is not the kind of series I'm prone to becoming obsessed with. The gross-out and offensive comedy is not something that appeals to me in the quantity that it occurs in South Park. Additionally, I'm well aware of the controversies of the series (especially the transphobia) which is something I do NOT want to associate myself with. I'm also aware of how problematic the fanbase (which is very large and leans younger than me) can be, and that scares me. It's mainly the 'lore' that's made me interested in the series, which is mostly written by the fans.\n  \n    Regardless, I am confident that I, under no circumstances, want to develop in interest in South Park.\n  \n    But when in starting to feel the signs of a new interest forming, I'm feeling very very anxious about it.\n  \n    I've already planned to go cold-turkey - to scroll past it on my TikTok, to not watch any more episodes, to quit talking about it with my friend. However, I'm worried I will fall back into indulging in it if I'm not careful and need to be able to hold myself back. I need to re-ignite my internet in my current special interests as well as giving myself stimulation from other less-obsessive series on the side.\n  \n    I don't know if any of this makes sense. It's helped to vent, though. I'm mainly looking for support to tell me that this is in fact possible to achieve. Thanks for taking the time to read.\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more"
